The generation at power plants declined from 10,567.83 MUs in 2017-18 to 5,466.81 MUs in 2020-21. The generation was below the normative generation approved by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) and ranged between 42.61 to 69.24 per cent during 2017-21. The main reason for low generation was higher variable cost of thermal power stations which resulted in plants not getting schedule and resultant backing down4 of plants. 1 Normative generation is the quantum of power generation based on Plant Load Factor determined by HERC every year keeping in view the capacity of the Unit. 2 Unit V was decommissioned during March 2020. However, unit remained shut down during 2019-20 also. 3 Generation data of Unit V of PTPS is excluded from total generation given at row number 5 and 10. 4 A backing down refers to shut down of the unit due to availability of cheaper power elsewhere or less demand. 9 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited Comparison of actual generation vis-à-vis normative generation approved by HERC is depicted in the chart below: Chart 2.1: Comparison of normative thermal generation approved by HERC"

    "text": "in non-achievement of normative PLF, Company could not recover fixed cost of ` 390.94 crore during 2016-21 from DISCOMs6. The plant wise details for forced outages, planned outages and Backing Down Instructions for the five years 2016-21 is given in Appendix 2.1. The main reasons for low PLF were forced outages7 due to various technical problems, poor planning in execution of works pertaining to capital overhauling which resulted into prolonged shutdown of plants and Backing Down Instructions (BDIs) of Units due to their higher variable cost. Out of total outages of 1,94,580 hours (56.92 per cent of total available 3,41,832 hours), as much as 47.76 per cent outages were due to backing down of plants at the instructions of the DISCOMs. Audit observed that had all the units been run on the PLF approved by HERC, additional 49,559.73 MUs of power valuing ` 15,576.80 crore could have been generated. Thus, Company lost the opportunity to earn potential revenue of ` 15,576.80 crore during 2016-21. Issues pertaining to non-recovery of fixed cost are discussed subsequently. The Management replied (May 2022) that effective steps have been taken to minimise the forced outages and reduce backing down of plants by minimizing the cost of power. However, the fact remains that actual PLF of each HPGCL unit was on decreasing trend during 2016-2021. 2.3 Auxiliary Power Consumption Auxiliary Power Consumption (APC) is power consumed by units themselves for running their equipments and common services. APC is expressed as a percentage of the gross energy generated by generating unit of the plant. HERC approves percentage of normative APC for each unit every year. The norms fixed by HERC ranged from six to ten per cent in respect of units of the Company during the period 2016-17 to 2020-21. Unit wise auxiliary power consumption is discussed below: 6 Uttar Hayana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited and Dakshin Hayana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited. 7 Forced outages is the period when the generating unit is not available for production of power due to unexpected breakdown of the unit. 11 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited Table 2.3: Auxiliary Power Consumption approved by the HERC vis-à-vis actual thereagainst Auxiliary Power Consumption8 (per cent) Name of Year 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Plant Unit HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual No. Norms Norms Norms Norms Norms PTPS V 10.00 15.95 10.00 16.12 10.00 14.81 De-commissioned VI 10.00 12.52 10.00 10.61 10.00 10.54 10.00 NA9 9.00 18.52 VII 8.50 9.20 9.00 8.97 9.00 8.65 8.50 9.29 8.50 9.93 VIII 8.50 10.00 9.00 9.48 9.00 8.30 8.50 8.91 8.50 10.04 DCRTPP I 8.50 8.67 8.50 8.62 8.50 8.69 8.50 8.41 8.50 8.37 II 8.50 8.90 8.50 8.36 8.50"

The APC in DCRTPP ranged between 8.37 to 8.69 per cent in respect of Unit-I and 8.27 to 8.90 per cent in respect of Unit-II against the norm of 8.50 per cent of both the Units. The APC in the units of RGTPP ranged between 5.92 to 7.84 per cent in respect of Unit-I and 5.89 to 8.49 per cent in respect of Unit-II against the norms of 6.00 per cent of both the Units. In addition, APC in the units of PTPS remained more than the norms fixed by HERC and it ranged between 8.3 per cent and 18.52 per cent during 2016-21, except during 2017-18 (for Unit VII – 8.97 per cent) and 2018-19 (for unit VII – 8.65 per cent and VIII- 8.30 per cent) It is seen from the table above that in eight units of three thermal power plants for five years, the APC was beyond HERC norms in 27 out of 38 combinations of units and years and within APC norms in remaining 11. APC beyond norms is a direct loss to the Company as it is not recoverable through tariff. Thus, due to higher APC (than norms), the Company suffered a loss of ` 49.45 crore on 140.33 MUs of power consumed in excess during 2016-21. The APC remained higher due to less running of plants which resulted in lesser generation and proportionately higher APC. The Management replied (May 2022) that the APC remained higher due to frequent starts/stops, backing down and running of units on partial load. Further, efforts have been made to reduce the APC by replacing conventional lights, installation of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) and reduction in Induced Drought fans & compressors. Audit is of the view that APC should be kept within norms determined by HERC. However, while calculating the excess consumption of APC, Audit has adjusted the APC when the units were boxed up/shut down. 8 Auxiliary Power Consumption data in the table is after adjustment of APC during shut down period. 9 Auxiliary Power Consumption is calculated as percentage of total generation. During 2019-20 unit-VI of PTPS remained boxed up"

During 2019-20 unit-VI of PTPS remained boxed up (shut down). Therefore, Auxiliary consumption cannot be calculated as percentage of total generation. However, total auxiliary power consumption in terms of Units was 5.10 MUs during 2019-20. 12 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants 2.4 Station Heat Rate Station Heat Rate (SHR) indicates the amount of fuel (heat) required to generate one unit of electricity. It is measured in kcal10 per kWh11. Plant’s efficiency is measured on the basis of its SHR. A Plant with higher SHR will consume more fuel in comparison to other plants with lower SHR. HERC has fixed normative SHR for each unit of the Company. The following table indicates HERC norms vis-à-vis actual SHR for each unit for the period 2016-17 to 2020-21: Table 2.4: Station Heat Rate approved by the HERC vis-à-vis actual Station Heat Rate of the units Station Heat Rate (Kcal/kWh) Year 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 Unit HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual HERC Actual No. Norms Norms Norms Norms Norms PTPS V 2,550 2,499 2,550 2,721 2,550 2,566 0 0 0 0 VI 2,550 2,519 2,550 2,653 2,550 2,540 2,550 0 2,550 2,537 VII 2,500 2,478 2,500 2,562 2,500 2,473 2,500 2,476 2,500 2,476 VIII 2,500 2,465 2,500 2,551 2,500 2,468 2,500 2,471 2,500 2,480 DCRTPP I 2,344 2,315 2,344 2,321 2,344 2,327 2,344 2,328 2,344 2,341 II 2,344 2,317 2,344 2,317 2,344 2,319 2,344 2,333 2,344 2,342 RGTPP I 2,387 2,589 2,387 2,523 2,387 2,461 2,387 2,476 2,387 2,431 II 2,387 2,573 2,387 2,505 2,387 2,419 2,387 2,442 2,387 2,461 Source: Information supplied by the Company and Tariff orders approved by the HERC for the year 2016-17 to 2020-21 The SHR in RGTPP remained higher than HERC norms in all the five years while in DCRTPP it was within norms during the period 2016-21. The SHR at PTPS was higher than HERC norms in 2017-18 in respect of all the units and higher in 2018-19 in respects of unit V. Higher SHR eventually led to higher consumption of coal resulting in higher variable cost and the unit not getting schedule. The Management replied (May 2022) that SHR remained higher than norms due to backing down of plants and low quality of coal. However, in MYT Regulation 2019, HERC has made provision for compensation on degradation of station heat rate due to low Plant utilization factor. The fact remains that SHR norms should have been adhered"

However, in MYT Regulation 2019, HERC has made provision for compensation on degradation of station heat rate due to low Plant utilization factor. The fact remains that SHR norms should have been adhered to. The Company did not adhere to the capital overhauling schedules as discussed in paragraphs 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 which was essential to maintain the operational parameters of the plant. Further, Management should take action to upgrade the technology of the plants and efforts should be made to improve the quality of coal and achieve the Station Heat Rate (SHR) norms as approved by Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission. 10 Kcal- Kilo calories is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kg of water to one degree Celsius. 11 KWh- Kilo watt per hour, it is a unit of energy measurement. 13 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited 2.5 Backing down of plants due to higher variable cost As per Regulation 59 of HERC Multi Year Tariff (MYT) Regulation, 2012 titled ‘Cost of power Purchase’, distribution licensees (DISCOMs) are bound to schedule power in accordance with the principles of merit order schedule and purchase power on the basis of ranking of all approved sources of supply in the order of their variable cost. Merit order12 is decided every month on the basis of variable cost (generation cost) and Point of Connection (POC) charges (transmission losses) of electricity by the generation stations. Most expensive generator is kept at the top of merit order and gets the least opportunity to supply the power to DISCOMs. The details of BDI issued by DISCOMs on account of low demand during 2016-17 to 2020-21 were as under: Table 2.5: Details of total operating hours and shut down period due to BDIs during 2016-21 Year Total Operating Shut down period due to BDI Shut down period due to BDI hours (in hours) (in percentage) DCRTPP Yamuna Nagar Unit-I Unit-II Unit-I Unit-II Unit-I Unit-II 2016-17 8,760 8,760 1,347 1,459 15.38 16.66 2017-18 8,760 8,760 1,291 806 14.74 9.20 2018-19 8,760 8,760 1,065 1,206 12.16 13.77 2019-20 8,784 8,784 2,906 1,350 33.08 15.37 2020-21 8,760 8,760 3,289 3,280 37.55 37.44 Total 43,824 43,824 9,898 8,101 22.59 18.49 RGTPP Hisar 2016-17 8,760 8,760 4,123 3,245 47.07 37.04 2017-18 8,760 8,760 3,290 2,531 37.56 28.89 2018-19 8,760 8,760 3,961 3,550 45.22 40.53 2019-20 8,784 8,784 3,681 5,197 41.91 59.16 2020-21 8,760 4,10413 5,189 3,240 59.24 78.95 Total 43,824 39,168 20,244 17,763 46.19 45.35 PTPS, Panipat Unit-VI Unit-VII Unit-VIII Unit-VI Unit-VII Unit-VIII 2016-17 8,760 8,760 7,541 3,550 5,559 86.08 40.52 63.46 2017-18 8,760 8,760 5,368 2,759 3,714 61.28"

Its Rank14 in merit order ranged 12 In this Performance Audit, the issue of preparation of merit order by Haryana Power Purchase Centre on behalf of both the DISCOMs has not been examined and no Audit opinion is formed on Merit order. 13 Operating hours of Unit-II (RGTPP) has been reduced to 4,104 hours due to damage of HIP Rotor on 19 September 2020 resulted into shutdown of unit till date (January 2022). 14 1st rank means most expensive and 32nd rank means most economical. 14 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants between 1st and 12th during 2016-17 to 2020-21 (Appendix 2.2). We noticed that due to its high rank in merit order, DCRTPP did not get schedule and lost the opportunity to earn potential revenue of ` 1,557.26 crore by not generating 4,589.75 MUs of power (Appendix 2.3). Rajiv Gandhi Thermal Power Plant (RGTPP) The shut down period due to BDI increased from 4,123 hours to 5,189 hours and from 3,245 to 5,197 hours in case of Unit-I and Unit-II respectively during 2016-21. Unit-II was under forced shut down due to damage of High Intermediate Pressure (HIP) Rotor since 19 September 2020. Scrutiny of Merit Order prepared by the Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC) showed that Variable Cost of RGTPP increased from ` 3.190 to ` 3.622 per unit from April 2016 to March 2021.

RGTPP was one of expensive plants among all 33 Power plants for which merit order was prepared. Its rank in merit order ranged between 1st and 13th during 2016-17 to 2020-21 (Appendix 2.2). Due to the high rank in merit order, RGTPP lost the opportunity to earn potential revenue of ` 6,666 crore by not generating 19,383.57 MUs of power (Appendix 2.3). Panipat Thermal Power Station (PTPS) During 2016-21, shut down period due to BDI ranged between 61.28 to 100 per cent of available hours for Unit VI, 31.50 to 57.51 per cent for Unit VII and 20.48 to 71.19 per cent for Unit VIII. The plant was given further BDI by Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC) due to its higher Variable Cost (VC). In merit order, its position ranged between 1st and 7th for Unit VI, 2nd and 13th for Unit VIII and 2nd and 10th for Unit VIII (Appendix 2.2). This resulted in lost opportunity to earn potential revenue of ` 5,226.35 crore by not generating 14,889.09 MUs of power (Appendix 2.3). The net effect of this non-getting of schedule is loss of potential revenue of ` 13,449.61 crore (Appendix 2.3). The Management contended (May 2022) the issue of backing down of plants due to higher variable cost. They stated that HPGCL plants were backed down on not being scheduled by DISCOMs due to erroneous Merit order Dispatch (MoD). The DISCOMs were not evaluating the power cost on cost to consumer or landed basis which impacted HPGCL scheduling. They added that HERC in its order dated 18 February 2021 had adjudicated that HPGCL don’t have any liability of Point of Connection (PoC) Charges, whereas the charges of wheeling electricity to state has been considered as fixed cost and thus level playing field has not been provided for HPGCL units. The matter of erroneous MoD has been challenged at APTEL and outcome of the same was awaited (May 2022). 15 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited Inherent Locational disadvantages to HPGCL Plants The variable cost for a generating plant (thermal) consists of fuel cost i.e., cost of coal and its transportation cost. The main reason for higher variable cost was transportation cost of coal. Coal is transported through Railways from collieries located at Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh having distance of more than 1,200 kms. In case of plants located at pitheads (coal mining sites), transportation cost of fuel remains minimum. Due to this, units of the Company could not compete with pithead plants in terms of variable cost. Comparison of fuel cost with its transportation/freight cost is"

Due to comparatively lower average transportation cost of coal at DCRTPP, the plant got more chances of scheduling of power, which resulted in better PLF. Further analysis showed instances of incorrect booking of expenditures in coal accounting (Coal Price Store Ledger) due to which variable cost was depicted higher than cost to be booked as discussed below: 2.5.1 Increase in variable cost due to incorrect booking of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) expenses in variable coal cost The generation tariff of the Company is determined by HERC every year as per Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) Regulations, 2012. The generation tariff consists of two parts - Annual fixed charges (Capacity charges) and Variable charges (Energy Charges). The fixed cost includes Return on equity, Interest and financing charges on loan capital, Interest on working capital, Depreciation and Operation & Maintenance expenses (O&M). The Energy Charges/ variable charges comprise mainly the primary fuel (coal) cost. The landed cost of fuel for the month includes price of coal corresponding to the grade of coal inclusive of royalty, taxes and duties as applicable, transportation cost by rail/road or any other means. The fuel cost also includes normative transit/ moisture losses and handling losses as percentage of the quantity of coal dispatched by the coal supply company during the month. The power generated from DCRTPP, RGTPP and PTPS is sold to DISCOMs of Haryana. Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC), on behalf of both the 16 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants DISCOMs, prepares a merit order of variable cost of available generators and accordingly releases the generation schedule to generators on the basis of variable cost of power.

Therefore, it is essential for the Company to control its variable costs to get schedule for generation of power. At RGTPP and PTPS, the landed cost of coal for 2016-21 also included cost of internal transportation of coal amounting to ` 72.69 crore and ` 9.12 crore respectively as detailed below: Table: 2.7: Cost of internal transportation and its handling cost ((((```` in crore) Period Cost of internal transportation Cost of internal coal handling Total of coal (Handling Charges) RGTPP 2016-17 1.97 24.57 26.54 2017-18 1.95 13.37 15.33 2018-19 9.05 3.98 13.02 2019-20 16.73 0.00 16.73 2020-21 1.07 0.00 1.07 Total 30.77 41.92 72.69 PTPS 2016-17 2.89 0.00 2.89 2017-18 2.18 0.00 2.18 2018-19 3.04 0.00 3.04 2019-20 1.01 0.00 1.01 Total 9.12 0.00 9.12 Source: Information supplied by the Company for the year 2016-17 to 2020-21 The expenditure on internal transportation of coal, which was a part of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) cost of coal handling plant and therefore it was to be charged to the fixed cost in O&M expenses, was treated as a variable cost. This resulted in a higher depiction of monthly Variable Cost ranging between ` 0.007 to ` 0.40 and ` 0.002 to ` 0.045 per unit at RGTPP and PTPS respectively during 2016-21. At the same time, DCRTPP, Yamuna Nagar correctly treated O&M expenses as part of fixed cost. Had O&M cost been excluded from the variable cost at RGTPP and PTPS, they would have been better placed in merit order in respective months and avoided/ reduced backing down. The Management replied (May 2022) that as per MYT Regulations, 2012, Energy Charge Rate (ECR) is calculated on the basis of GCV of coal on ‘fired basis’. It means that it included all expenditures incurred till Boiler front. Now, as per 2nd amendment in MYT Regulations, GCV on ‘As Received basis’ will be considered and all the expenditure on account of same will be booked under O&M. The point stays that expenditure incurred on internal transportation of coal which should have been part of O&M of plant as booked by DCRTPP to minimize the variable cost and backing down of plants was not done at RGTPP and PTPS. 17 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited 2.5.2 Loading of transit gain into monthly coal cost resulted into higher variable cost Regulation 32 (i) of Multi Year Tariff (MYT) Regulations, 2012 provides that ‘for working out the landed cost of"

Clause 10.2.1 of Coal Accounting Manual under which Coal Price Stores Ledger (CPSL) is prepared, provides that the CPSL forms an important element of coal accounting, whereby all adjustments of coal quantities (received, consumed, lost in transit and handling, etc.) as well as adjustment related to all coal payments and receipts on account of claims raised are summarised. Clause 10.2.3 provides that CPSL preparation includes adjustments on account of transit and handling loss. Clause 10.5.2 provides that actual transit loss if less than the normative transit loss, should be adjusted in the CPSL. Scrutiny of CPSL of all the plants of the Company revealed that wherever there was transit gain or the actual transit loss was less than the normative level, the thermal plants of the Company had booked the proportionate cost of it in the CPSL despite the fact that this cost was not paid by the Company. This has resulted in increase in variable cost for such months and thus adversely impacted the schedule for generation. These plants, however, at the end of the year (in March) adjusted the net impact of such transit gain/loss lesser than normative, which reduced the variable cost of March only every year. This led to increase in monthly weighted average variable cost by ` 0.040 in DCRTPP, ` 0.051 in PTPS and ` 0.021 in RGTPP during the months when transit gain was noticed or transit loss was less than normative level. The Management replied (May 2022) that whole benefit of transit gain is transferred to the DISCOMs at the end of financial year. If Company follows the process of booking of actual gain/losses on monthly basis, then it will not be beneficial either for DISCOMs or for HPGCL. The reply is not tenable because the Company gets schedule as per merit order prepared on monthly basis. Therefore, any impact of transit gain should be accounted for on monthly basis to reduce the monthly variable cost and backing down of plants.

Due to increase in 18 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants Variable Cost as a result of above wrong bookings, HPGCL plants deprived themselves of scheduling of power during 20 months which translates into loss of revenue amounting to ` 1,505.90 crore for generation of 4,582.41 MUs to HPGCL. Further, this also resulted into increase in power purchase cost to Haryana DISCOMs by ` 99.62 crore for 4,582.41 MUs. 2.6 Repair and Maintenance of Power Plants Efficiency of the plant and equipment and their availability for power generation is dependent on adherence to annual maintenance and equipment overhauling schedules. Failure to adhere to these schedules results in higher consumption of coal, fuel oil and higher forced outages and resultant increase in the cost of power generated. These issues also have an impact on variable cost and consequently on merit order as well as impact on operationality in view of provisions of backing down and impact of the same could not be quantified in Audit. Audit findings in respect of overhauling works at Company’s plants are discussed in succeeding paragraphs: (A) Rajiv Gandhi Thermal Power Plant (RGTPP) RGTPP has installed capacity of 1200 MW having two Units of 600 MW each which were commissioned on 24 August 2010 and 1 March 2011 respectively. As per Operational Manual of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the plant, Class-A service i.e., Capital overhauling was required to be conducted within an interval of four to six years depending upon the operating status of the concerned unit. Audit noticed: 2.6.1 Poor execution of capital overhauling works OEM suggested (January 2017) for capital overhauling of Turbine and Generator of Unit-I to overcome the operational problems of higher heat rate, high vibration, leakage of hydrogen from Generator. The Company also decided (March 2017) to revive two Electro Static Precipitators (ESPs) (nos. A1 and A9) of Unit-I which were out of order due to their damaged internals. The Company accorded (April 2017) administrative approval for revival of the two damaged ESPs and overhauling of remaining 62 ESPs on open tender basis to make the plant meet the new environmental norms and also decided to carry out suggested capital overhauling. The Board of Directors (BoDs) of the Company approved (July 2017) the capital overhauling of Unit-I to be done during January to March 2018 for a"

The Board of Directors (BoDs) of the Company approved (July 2017) the capital overhauling of Unit-I to be done during January to March 2018 for a period of 60 days at an estimated cost of ` 43.40 crore. The Company issued NIT for revival of two ESPs and overhauling of remaining 62 ESPs fields in October 2017 but the work order was issued only by August 2018. Thus, due to delay in award of work of ESPs, the Company had to reschedule (September 2018) the planned capital overhauling to February 2019. 19 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited The Unit suffered from technical defects repeatedly during January 2018 to December 2019 but the Company persisted with operating the plant against technical advice leading to forced outages for 92 days resulting in loss of generation of 1,124.55 MUs equivalent to ` 379.28 crore. In the meantime, Company decided to schedule the Cooling Tower repair also along with capital overhauling of Unit I and awarded (23 October 2019) work for repair of cooling tower. Due to this, Capital overhauling was rescheduled to October 2019 and thereafter from 15 February 2020 to 29 April 2020 (75 days). Audit observed that the Unit-I was under forced shut down from 23 November 2019 due to technical faults. During this forced shut down period, the Company advanced the preponed Capital Overhauling schedule (15 February 2020 to 29 April 2020) for 75 days to 16 December 2019 to 28 February 2020. However, this capital overhauling could be completed by 4 May 2020, a delay of 65 days. The Unit-I was synchronized on 7 May 2020 (by taking 143 days). Thus, the Capital overhauling was carried out after two years and took 68 extra days than the scheduled plan. The delay in finalisation of work order for revival and overhauling of ESPs and inclusion of the repair work of cooling tower which was finalized in October 2019 were the contributing factors for the delay in scheduling the Capital Overhaul. The delay and excess time taken in overhauling had led to identifiable generation loss of 832.32 MUs valuing ` 296.64 crore for 68 days of Unit-I due to extra days taken in Capital Overhauling, loss of generation of 1,124.55 MUs valuing ` 379.28 crore due to forced shutdowns during January 2018 to December 2019.

Further, due to Covid-19, there was delay in supply of spares from China. The reply is not tenable as Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) suggested for capital overhauling during 2017 itself and Management took more than two years to commence the work. The capital overhauling works should have been planned and executed in a coordinated and timely manner which could have minimized the loss of fixed cost. 2.6.2 Delay in repair of High Intermediate Pressure Rotor of Unit-II of RGTPP The Capital overhauling of the Unit-II was scheduled from 15 February 2021 to 30 April 2021. The Unit-II was backed down from 13 September 2020 to 18 September 2020. On obtaining schedule, it was lighted up (19 September 2020) when it developed technical fault. The OEM on inspection recommended (13 October 2020) shutting down the unit and overhauling of Turbine Generator set and repair of High Intermediate Pressure Rotor (HIP Rotor). 20 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants OEM submitted (December 2020) an offer for ` 27.80 crore which included ` 9.74 crore for overhauling of the Unit and ` 3.08 crore for repair while ` 14.08 crore was for transportation of Rotor to China based OEM. The Company placed (20 February 2021) a work order to OEM for ` 11.25 crore (excluding transportation). OEM after dismantlement and inspection of the damaged turbine and HIP Rotor concluded that the equipment was not repairable and suggested (March 2021) for replacement. To bring the unit operational at the earliest, the Company decided (June 2021) to procure one old HIP Rotor also. Audit observed that Unit-II of RGTPP which was commissioned in March 2011 had remained under forced shutdown during 2013-14 also when the HIP Rotor was sent to OEM in China for repair. At that time, Rotor was within Guarantee/ warranty period, so the repair cost was borne by the Contractor. This time the same HIP Rotor was damaged but was out of warranty. The Company had however, not carried out any cost benefit analysis either go for repair or purchase a new rotor in view of high transportation cost against a very small component of repair cost and loss of fixed cost of ` 0.97 crore per day as well as that of generation of 12.24 MUs per day.

Company placed (July 2021) a purchase order for procurement of two HIP Rotors at a value of US $ 48.50 lakh (one fully bladed new HIP Rotor at US $ 37.50 lakh and one fully blades old HIP Rotor at US $11 lakh) i.e., at ` 47.74 crore15 inclusive of taxes and duties. OEM was required to ship new HIP Rotor within 13 Months from the date of issue of PO and the old HIP Rotor was to be shipped within six Months from the date of issue of PO and after receipt of 30 per cent advance payment of old Rotor. HIP Rotor has been received during January 2022 but unit could not be commissioned due to non-receipt of associated spares. Thus, fixed cost of ` 396.77 crore16 could not be recovered from DISCOMs apart from loss of potential revenue for forced shutdown period. The Management replied (May 2022) that work was delayed due to covid-19 restrictions and the HIP Rotor has been received during January 2022 but unit could not be commissioned due to non-receipt of necessary associated spares from China due to lock down restrictions. The reply is not tenable as Management should have assessed the requirement of associated spares at the time of placing purchase order for HIP Rotor so that associated material would be received along with HIP Rotor. 15 Based on $1 = ` 74.05 as on 29 April 2021 as per RBI rates. 16 ` 132.07 crore for period 20 September 2020 to March 2021 and ` 264.70 crore for the period April 2021 to December 2021. 21 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (B) Deen Bandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Plant (DCRTPP) Unit I and Unit II of DCRTPP, Yamuna Nagar were commissioned in April 2008 and June 2008 respectively.

The Company issued work order on OEM for capital overhauling of Turbine and Generator of both the Units with a contract cost of ` 9.19 crore in January 2018. Audit observed: 2.6.3 Capital overhauling of Unit I Capital Overhauling works of Unit I, planned for 12 March 2016 to 10 May 2016, could not be finalised timely and the work order could be issued only on 9 January 2018. At the same time the work of revival and repair of ESP was decided to be executed. The Company awarded (October 2017) this work to a firm at a cost of ` 27.61 crore which took about four months for arranging the ESP spares from the time of issue of letter of intent (September 2017) further delaying the Overhauling schedule. The Capital Overhauling time of Unit-I was re-scheduled from 1 February 2018 to 1 April 2018. Thus, the delay of 22 months in awarding the Capital Overhauling work of Unit I and ESP Revival and repair work pushed the Capital overhauling scheduled date from May 2016 to February 2018. Further, insulation and cladding works at Turbine Generator I and II, Boiler Maintenance Division I and II, areas and their auxiliaries’ area were awarded on 14 March 2018 (after 41 days from the start of Capital Overhauling of Unit-I) with a schedule completion period of 60 days. This contributed to overall delay in capital overhauling work which was eventually completed on 5 May 2018 by taking extra 34 days than planned. Company noticed (May 2018) other technical abnormalities in Unit-I subsequent to overhauling which required shutting down of the Unit-I for 30 days. After shutdown undertaken (8 October 2018), the Unit-I was synchronised on 19 December 2018 after repairs. The Unit-I remained shut for further 72 days (i.e., 8 October 2018 to 19 December 2018) after Capital overhauling w.e.f. 1 February 2018 to 5 May 2018 (94 days). 22 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants Thus, Capital Overhauling of Unit-I carried out after delay of 22 months and taking 34 extra days than planned resulted in generation loss of 208.08 MUs equivalent to ` 70.96 crore for 34 days of Unit-I. The Company also could not recover fixed cost of ` 39.03 crore from the DISCOMs. The Management replied (May 2022) that work was delayed due to late award of capital overhauling/ESP works because some works were awarded on propriety basis and some through NITs.

Further, for awarding the contract lots of procedures/approvals were required. The reply is not tenable as Management was aware about the time required/necessary approvals for tendering/propriety basis and issue of Work orders. 2.6.4 Capital overhauling of Unit II Capital Overhauling work of Unit II was planned during 12 May 2017 to 10 July 2017 (60 days). The schedule was revised multiple times and finally 1 November 2019 to 14 January 2020 (75 days). The capital overhauling work was eventually carried out between 1 November 2019 and 10 February 2020 (102 days) taking 42 days more than the planned period. The work of revival and repair of ESP was also included in Capital Overhauling work. The delay was attributed to: • Capital overhauling work of Unit I was delayed up to February 2018 which delayed start of Capital Overhauling of Unit II. • The Company had planned Capital Overhauling during peak summer/ paddy season of April-June and July-September during 2018 and 2019 respectively which was not allowed by Haryana Power Purchase Centre (HPPC). Accordingly, Capital Overhauling of Unit-II was delayed. • Insulation and cladding work at Turbine Generator I and II, Boiler Maintenance Division I and II areas and their auxiliaries’ area was also required to be carried out during Capital overhauling of these units. The work was awarded on 14 March 2018 with a schedule completion period of 60 days. The validity of the rates was for one year i.e. up to March 2019. The Company could not start work of Capital Overhauling of Unit II during the period in which rate of insulation and cladding work was valid. Accordingly, Company floated a new NIT and re-awarded (19 December 2019) (after a delay of 49 days from planned Capital Overhauling of Unit II). Thus, Capital Overhauling of Unit II was carried out after delay of 29 months and took 42 extra days than original planned 60 days and 27 days extra from revised plan due to awarding of various works17 of Capital Overhauling and related works at different time intervals and planning of overhauling during 17 Award of Capital Overhauling work, re-awarding of Insulation & Cladding work to and non-availability of shut down from HPPC during paddy/summer season. 23 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited peak season due to ill planning by the Company.

The Company could not recover fixed cost of ` 48.82 crore also from the DISCOMs. The Management replied (May 2022) that work was delayed due to latein award of ESP revival work and delay in completion of capital overhauling of Unit-1. Reply is not tenable as reasons for delay could have been avoided had the Company awarded the works as per capital overhauling plan. (C) Panipat Thermal Power Station 2.6.5 Avoidable expenditure due to deficient terms and conditions of the Operation and Maintenance contract The Company awarded (July 2014) work for complete operation and maintenance of two Coal Handling Plants (CHP-II for Units V & VI and CHP-III for Units VII & VIII) along with other allied works at Panipat Thermal Power Station (PTPS) for the period of three years from August 2014 to July 2017 at the following rates: Table 2.8: Details of period and cost of O&M contract Sr. Year Period Rate per annum (excluding No. taxes) (```` in crore) 1 First Year 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 22.00 2 Second Year 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 23.10 3 Third Year 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017 24.20 Total amount for three years (exclusive of taxes) 69.30 Source: Compiled from the records of company. Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission in its tariff order for the year 2016-17, reduced the normative PLF from 60 to 35 per cent and normative O&M expenses by considering the low level of PLF achieved by Unit V and VI. The Company, therefore, decided (June 2016) to foreclose the contract to keep the O&M cost within norms and also float fresh NIT with revised scope of work. Accordingly, the Company reduced the scope of work18 as per HERC norms with an estimated value ` 14.08 crore p.a. (41.80 per cent less than the contract value of ` 24.20 crore p.a.). Thereafter, NIT was floated (October 2016) and offered rate of L-I firm of ` 13.14 crore p.a. was received. Audit scrutiny revealed that as there was no clause for foreclosing the contract in the existing work order and the Company did not issue fresh work order during January 2017 to July 2017. The Company held negotiations with the firm for reduction in existing rates who offered (September 2016) a rebate of ` 4.20 crore per annum as per 18 By taking 35 per cent PLF"

The Company held negotiations with the firm for reduction in existing rates who offered (September 2016) a rebate of ` 4.20 crore per annum as per 18 By taking 35 per cent PLF of Units V and VI and 85 per cent PLF of Units VII and VIII. 24 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants revised scope of work with the condition that the existing work order may be extended for further two years (4th and 5th year) at the revised offered rate i.e. ` 20 crore (` 24.20 crore minus rebate of ` 4.20 crore). The Company analysed offered rates were still on higher side and decided not to accept the revised offer. Audit observed that while deciding the terms and conditions of a contract, Company had not inserted the enforceable clauses of reduction in scope of work and foreclosure. Accordingly, Company had to pay at higher rates (` 24.20 crore p.a.) to the firm despite receipt of reduced rates of ` 13.14 crore p.a. in January 2017. Thus, due to deficient terms and conditions of the O&M Contract, the Company could not foreclose the contract and had to pay ` 13.48 crore to the firm during February to July 2017 against ` 7.39 crore as per lowest rates discovered. This has resulted in avoidable expenditure of ` 6.09 crore and the ultimate burden was passed to the consumers The Management replied (May 2022) that there was no clause in the contract to close the contract intermittently. Further, the contract was made considering the power deficit scenario in the State. Audit is of the view that suitable clauses for short closure/reduction in scope of work should have been incorporated keeping in view the scenario of decreasing PLF and age of Units V and VI of PTPS. (D) Western Yamuna Canal Hydro Electric Project 2.6.6 Delay in overhauling work of machines due to acceptance of non-interchangeable blades resulted into loss of green energy The Company had commissioned four Power Houses namely A, B, C and D during 1986, 1987, 1989 and 2004 respectively at Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) Hydro Electric project at Bhudkalan, Yamuna Nagar with a total capacity of 62.4 MW. The Machines B1, C1 and C2 were running on partial load and to improve their efficiency, the Company placed (October 2015) a Purchase Order (PO) for purchase of four sets of runner blades on the OEM19 at a cost of ` 8.48 crore for the capital overhauling of Machines.

The supplied material was to be identical and interchangeable amongst the different machines. The Guarantee/warranty period was 12 months from the date when the product was put to use or 18 months from the date of dispatch whichever was earlier. The material supplied during July & September 2016 certified that all the components and equipments were identical in construction, interchangeable and suitable to the equipments already installed at WYC, Hydel Yamuna Nagar. The following was observed: 19 M/s Voith Hydro Pvt limited. 25 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited Overhauling of Machine B-1 The Company issued work order (November 2017) for Capital overhauling of Machine B-1 to a contractor which was carried out from 8 December 2017 to 7 March 2018. The Company observed (March 2018) that despite Capital Overhauling, the Machine could achieve load of six MW only against the desired load of 7.5 MW. The low generation was taken up (March 2018) with contractor who attributed it to fault in new runner blades supplied by OEM. It was then observed that new blades procured from OEM were not identical/inter-changeable as certified and needed technical adjustment from the supplier/ OEM. As a result, despite its capital overhauling, the desired load could not be achieved and machine B-1 kept running on partial load of six MW. Audit observed that despite knowing this fact, Company did not make any efforts to get the blades of Machine B-1 replaced from the OEM and let the machine B-1 to perform at lower load (April 2018 to June 2021) which resulted in generation loss of 27.336 MUs of green energy. Overhauling of Machine C-1 Thereafter, during December 2017, the Company issued another work order for Repair Modernisation and Upgradation (RM&U) of turbine and generator of Machines C1 and C2 to a firm. The machine C1 was given to the firm on 13 March 2018 with scheduled date of completion as 12 September 2018. As the blades were not inter-changeable, the Company sent (May 2018) them to OEM for carrying out technical adjustment which were received back in December 2018. Due to this reason, C-1 Machine could be commissioned on 25 January 2019 with a delay of 134 days. It was observed that after overhauling the Machine successfully achieved the desired load level of 7.5 MW, but the delay in commissioning of machine resulted in generation loss of 15.44 MUs of green energy. Overhauling of Machine C-2 Audit noticed that despite successful completion of RM&U work at Machine C-1 in January 2019, the Company"

Overhauling of Machine C-2 Audit noticed that despite successful completion of RM&U work at Machine C-1 in January 2019, the Company took almost one year for providing site for overhauling work of C-2 machine. The work of overhauling of C-2 Machine was started by 17 January 2020 with scheduled date of completion as 16 July 2020. However, the work of overhauling was yet to be completed (July 2021). The main reasons for delay were extra repair work carried out by the firm on the non-inter-changeable blades supplied by OEM and spread of Covid-19 pandemic. 26 Chapter 2: Operation and maintenance of Generating Plants Table 2.9: Details of period of capital overhauling contract Reasons for delay Period Period Total period from the commencement of work 17 January 2020 to 17 July 2021 18 months Delay on account of COVID March to May- 2020 6 Months March to May- 2021 Period allowed to firm 6 months Delay till July 2021 6 months Source: Compiled from the records of company. Delayed completion of overhauling work of machine C-2 resulted in loss of generation 21.0275 MUs of green energy. Therefore, there was total generation loss of 63.80 MUs of green energy valuing ` 30.73 crore in respect of all the three Machines due to acceptance of non-inter-changeable blades and delay in completion of overhauling work in Machine B-1, C-1 and C-2. Further, the Company had to bear higher inventory carrying cost due to delayed utilisation of runner blades. It was further observed that although fixed cost of hydel project was recovered by the Company by achieving the normative PLF, but due to lesser generation, DISCOMs had to purchase 63.80 MUs of power from other sources which resulted into extra burden to the extent of ` 30.73 crore20 on the state consumers. The Management replied (May 2022) that the matter was pursued with the OEM and correction work on blades in all three machines has now been completed and machines are running at full load. The reply is not tenable as Management took more than two years in taking corrective action after detection of fitment issues during March 2018 which resulted in generation loss of green energy. 2.7 Conclusion The generation of the Company declined from 10,567.83 MUs in 2017-18 to 5,466.81 MUs in 2020-21, even far below the normative generation approved by the HERC and the shortfall ranged between 42.61 to 69.24 per cent during 2017-21. The main reason for low generation was higher variable cost of thermal power stations which resulted in backing down"

The main reason for low generation was higher variable cost of thermal power stations which resulted in backing down of plants. The Plant Load Factor in respect of all units of the Company decreased substantially due to forced outages on account of various technical problems, poor planning in execution of works pertaining to capital overhauling. Due to non-achievement of normative PLF, Company could not recover fixed cost of ` 390.94 crore during 2016-21 from the DISCOMs. The Company lost the opportunity to earn potential revenue of ` 15,576.80 crore on non-production 20 Calculated on the basis of DPR data 42.055 MUs per year @ 7.5 MW Load of machine B-1, C-1 and C-2 and average power purchase cost of respective years. 27 Functioning of Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited of 49,559.73 MUs of power during 2016-21 due to non-achievement of normative PLF. As per merit order, plants of the Company were one of expensive plants amongst the 33 Power plants for which merit order is prepared by DISCOMs. Their ranks in merit order ranged between 1st and 13th during 2016-17 to 2020-21 Thus, the position of the thermal plants in merit order deteriorated due to which the Company lost opportunity of earning potential revenue of ` 13,449.61 crore by not generating 38,862.43 MUs of power. Further, due to higher transportation cost of coal the units of the Company could not compete with Pithead plants in terms of variable cost. The deficiency in coal accounting and O&M further accentuated the adverse impact on merit order. The consistent poor performance on O&M processes by the Company and deficient coal accounting carries the risk of it being by design in place of inefficiencies as competitors in the merit order include six private entities. The HIP Rotor of Unit-II of RGTPP got damaged (September 2020) due to irregular loading pattern, frequent start and stop operations. The Company had however, not carried out any cost benefit analysis either go for repair or purchase a new rotor in view of high transportation cost against the small amount on repair cost and loss of fixed cost of ` 0.97 crore per day besides loss of generation of 12.24 MUs per day. The HIP Rotor has not been replaced as yet (December 2021) resulting in non-recovery of fixed cost of ` 396.77 crore from the DISCOMs. The Company has suffered generation loss of 63.80 MUs of green energy valuing ` 30.73 crore in respect of Western Yamuna Canal Hydro Electric Project due to acceptance of non-inter-changeable blades"

Se han obtenido los datos de los parámetros necesarios durante la estancia, como temperaturas, presiones, caudales, para los futuros cálculos de rendimiento. Objetivos Es objeto de este informe presentar los conocimientos obtenidos durante la estancia en la Central Térmica de Compostilla así como su asimilación y redacción. Dichos conocimientos permitirán ayudar a la realización de un proyecto fin de carrera basado en la Central Térmica de Compostilla en el cual se realizarán cálculos de rendimientos, caudales y emisiones así como el funcionamiento y mantenimiento de los elementos que realizan el proceso térmico, desde la generación de vapor hasta su transformación en energía eléctrica, de un grupo específico de la central. Se pretende obtener una familiarización de todos los elementos que intervienen en la transformación de energía potencial del vapor en energía eléctrica en el alternador así como de los procesos que llevan a cabo cada uno. Se pretende obtener una visión global del funcionamiento de la central ya sea en los ámbitos de contratación, formación de empleados, mantenimiento, recursos humanos, servicios de los empleados, medioambiente, etc. Página 7 Central Térmica de Compostilla Caldera Introducción El generador de vapor es de recalentamiento de fase única. Consiste en una unidad de circulación natural. Las calderas de circulación natural se caracterizan porque el flujo de agua ascendente generado en los tubos vaporizadores, se forma de manera natural a causa de la variación de densidad, que disminuye con la temperatura. Para facilitar este flujo en las calderas de circulación natural se deben minimizar las pérdidas de carga que pueden ser originadas por la velocidad del flujo, el diámetro del conducto y la disposición de los Figura 1. Circulación natural. tubos. Por este motivo la disposición de los tubos en este tipo de caldearas es vertical, evitando cuando sea posible los giros. La caldera quema carbón pulverizado en un hogar de tiro equilibrado. El peso específico del agua disminuye en relación a la vaporización conseguida, de manera que cuanto mayor sea la vaporización, mayor será la disminución del peso específico. Este proceso se da gracias a la aportación de calor a los tubos que constituyen las paredes del hogar y que contienen agua, la cual se calienta. La caldera está diseñada de manera que los tubos bajantes, (Fig. 1), no estén sometidos al calor producido en el hogar por la combustión del carbón y de esta manera poder conseguir una diferencia de pesos específicos entre la columna de agua- vapor que asciende al calderín y los bajantes que descienden al domo inferior.

Página 8 Central Térmica de Compostilla Con esto se consigue una buena refrigeración de los tubos de las paredes del hogar y se facilita la circulación natural. Análisis Circuito agua-vapor Podemos clasificar el circuito en dos grupos: 1. Circuito de agua  Absorbe el calor desarrollado en el hogar para calentar y vaporizar el agua procedente de los calentadores de alta presión. 2. Circuito de vapor - Sistema de vapor principal  Suministra a la turbina de alta presión el vapor producido por la caldera dentro del rango de los parámetros de funcionamiento óptimos.  Mediante el by-pass de alta presión lleva el vapor de salida de la caldera al conducto de recalentado frío, para derivar el vapor de la turbina de alta presión. - Sistema de vapor recalentado  Mejora el rendimiento del ciclo al recalentar el vapor procedente de la turbina de alta presión y llevarlo al cuerpo de presión intermedia alta.  Mediante el by-pass de baja presión conduce el vapor recalentado al condensador, derivando el vapor de la turbina de baja presión. Página 9 Central Térmica de Compostilla Funcionamiento El agua de alimentación llega por una tubería procedente del calentador nº 6 de alta presión que en la proximidad de la caldera se bifurca en dos tuberías para entrar por ambos lados al colector de entrada del economizador inferior. Dicha agua debe calentarse antes de entrar en el calderín ya que, en éste existen las dos fases, agua y vapor. Si introducimos agua a baja temperatura, la transferencia de energía térmica se vería aumentada a causa de la diferencia de temperaturas y podría llegar a condensarse el vapor perteneciente al calderín.  En ambas tuberías de entrada al economizador inferior, antes de la entrada al colector, existen válvulas de bloqueo y de retención.  En la tubería de agua de alimentación a la caldera hay una conexión procedente de la bomba de llenado de caldera para el llenado de ésta por el economizador. Del economizador inferior, el agua, pasa al economizador superior a través de dos tuberías interiores. El agua circula por ambos economizadores en sentido contrario al sentido de circulación de los gases, para forzar una mayor transferencia de calor. Del colector de salida del economizador superior, el agua sale por tuberías externas a la caldera y entra en el calderín por ambos lados, ya que el calderín está ubicado en la parte superior de la caldera, de manera"

    "text": "circulación de los gases, para forzar una mayor transferencia de calor. Del colector de salida del economizador superior, el agua sale por tuberías externas a la caldera y entra en el calderín por ambos lados, ya que el calderín está ubicado en la parte superior de la caldera, de manera transversal, sobresaliendo de la misma por sus dos extremidades. Figura 2. Sección Calderín En el interior del calderín (Fig.2) se divide en dos tuberías formando una especie de elipse. El agua sale de dichos Página 10 Central Térmica de Compostilla tubos a través de unos orificios que poseen longitudinalmente, con lo que se logra una mejor distribución del agua en el calderín (Fig. 3). El agua de alimentación se mezcla en el calderín con el Figura 3. Calderín agua procedente de las paredes de agua del hogar, a través de tuberías exteriores descendentes (downcomers). Del calderín el agua en fase líquida sale por 19 downcomers o bajantes y mediante los feeders (tubos alimentadores) se alimentan las paredes de agua (zona del hogar). El agua recorre dichas paredes en sentido ascendente a causa de que el vapor se produce cuando el agua, al calentarse, fluye hacia arriba a través de los tubos de las paredes del hogar. Al formarse vapor se produce una diferencia de pesos entre la columna de líquido presente en las tuberías descendentes y la de las tuberías ascendentes. Esta es la causa que origina la circulación natural en la caldera, como se ha visto anteriormente. La intensidad de la circulación aumenta, cuanto mayor es el volumen ocupado por el vapor en la columna ascendente, por lo que interesa producir la vaporización en la parte más baja de la caldera. Si se eleva la presión de funcionamiento, disminuye el volumen específico del vapor y aumenta el del agua, con lo que disminuye la diferencia de pesos entre las dos columnas haciéndose menor la circulación. Figura 4. Distribución tubos Página 11 Central Térmica de Compostilla Cerca de la presión crítica (unos 230 Kg/cm2) la circulación natural deja de ser posible. La mezcla de agua-vapor, entra por los risers (Fig. 4) al calderín, pasando por los ciclones separadores, donde se separan el agua y el vapor. Del calderín, el vapor saturado sale por unos tubos de transferencia al colector de entrada de vapor en el techo de la caldera. Del colector de entrada al techo de la caldera, el vapor, recorre todo el techo dirigiéndose hacia la parte trasera hasta el colector de salida del techo de la caldera. Desde dicho colector, el vapor se divide en dos circuitos:  Por una parte el vapor pasa a los tubos que forman la pared trasera y la recorre en sentido descendente"

Desde dicho colector, el vapor se divide en dos circuitos:  Por una parte el vapor pasa a los tubos que forman la pared trasera y la recorre en sentido descendente hasta su domo inferior. Desde dicho domo, el vapor pasa por unos tubos de transferencia al colector inferior de la pared frontal y al colector inferior de la pared divisoria o pared de partición. El vapor Figura 5. Cámara estanca superior asciende por ambas paredes hasta el colector de recogida de las paredes frontal en la cámara estanca superior (Fig. 5).  Por otra parte, del colector de salida del techo de la caldera, mediante unos tubos de transferencia, se envía vapor a los colectores de entrada de las paredes laterales. Las paredes laterales tienen 3 colectores de entrada y 3 paneles de tubos descendentes por cada pared. Desde dichos colectores el vapor recorre los 3 paneles Página 12 Central Térmica de Compostilla de las paredes laterales hasta los 3 colectores inferiores en cada pared. De los colectores inferiores, por unos tubos de transferencia, el vapor pasa a los 2 colectores inferiores por cada pared lateral ascendiendo por dichas paredes hasta los colectores superiores o de salida de las paredes laterales. El vapor procedente de la zona de apertura del hogar, junto con el que procede de la pared frontal y la pared de partición, se recoge en el colector de recogidas de vapor de las paredes de dichas zonas. Desde este último colector, el vapor sale por dos tubos exteriores a la caldera, y desciende hacia el colector de entrada al sobrecalentador primario. El vapor recorre los serpentines de dicho sobrecalentador y eleva su temperatura, hasta su colector de salida. Del colector de salida del sobrecalentador primario, el vapor sale por dos tuberías exteriores a la caldera, dirigiéndose al colector de entrada de las paredes divisorias o radiantes. Son llamadas radiantes por estar directamente expuestas a las llamas del hogar. De dicho colector de entrada parten los 8 paneles que forman las 8 paredes divisorias que constituyen el sobrecalentador radiante, juntándose el vapor en dos colectores superiores en el interior de la cámara estanca superior: colector de salida radiante lado izquierdo y lado derecho. De dichos colectores el vapor sale por unos tubos de transferencia a dos tuberías o colectores (uno por cada lado) y pasa a los colectores de entrada del sobrecalentador final (colector lado derecho y lado izquierdo). Del colector de salida del radiante lado izquierdo, el vapor pasa al colector de entrada al sobrecalentador final lado derecho y del colector de salida del radiante lado derecho"

Del colector de salida del radiante lado izquierdo, el vapor pasa al colector de entrada al sobrecalentador final lado derecho y del colector de salida del radiante lado derecho al de entrada al sobrecalentador lado izquierdo. Esto es así para compensar y equilibrar las diferencias que puedan existir entre uno y otro lado, debidas a las condiciones de la combustión. De los dos colectores de entrada al sobrecalentador final, el vapor se distribuye a las botellas de entrada de cada serpentín. Fluye a través de los serpentines hasta el colector de salida del sobrecalentador final y de este colector, por el lado izquierdo de la caldera, el vapor sale hacia la turbina a partir de la válvula principal de vapor (VP1). Página 13 Central Térmica de Compostilla Tanto el sobrecalentador primario, como el final, son de convección porque toman la energía de los gases de la combustión y no como el de radiación, que toma directamente la energía radiante de las llamas del hogar. El vapor después de ceder parte de su energía en la turbina de alta presión, retorna a la caldera para elevar su temperatura y mejorar así el rendimiento del ciclo. Este recalentamiento se origina mediante un recalentador intermedio. El control de temperatura de ese vapor, se realiza por medio de compuertas que regulan el flujo de gases a través del recalentador. Además hay un control de temperatura de emergencia por medio de un atemperador cuyo fluido de trabajo es agua. El grupo va equipado con dos sistemas de by-pass: uno de alta presión y el otro de baja presión, que pueden funcionar durante la puesta en marcha, disparos del turbo generador, etc. El by-pass de alta presión, toma el vapor de la salida del sobrecalentador, lo acondiciona a la presión y temperatura de las características del vapor recalentado frío y lo pasa al recalentador. El by-pass de baja presión, toma el vapor a la salida del recalentador (recalentado caliente) y acondicionándolo de nuevo, lo lleva al condensador de la turbina. Se trata de un circuito que puede derivar parcial o totalmente el vapor de la turbina, según lo aconsejen las condiciones de operación, teniendo en cuenta que es condición indispensable, que exista vacío en el condensador. El sistema tiene una capacidad del 30% del caudal a plena carga y ha sido diseñado para las temperaturas y presiones nominales.

De los colectores de transferencia del sobrecalentador de radiación al sobrecalentador final también se toma el vapor para el soplado de caldera. Cada equipo de atemperación está compuesto por las siguientes válvulas:  Una válvula automática de control, que regula el caudal de agua para mantener la temperatura del vapor.  Una ó dos válvulas de bloqueo manuales.  Una válvula automática de cierre rápido, que se cierra al cerrarse la válvula de control correspondiente y se abre cuando la válvula de control alcanza un 10 % de apertura. Figura 7. Válvulas atemperación Página 16 Central Térmica de Compostilla Circuito aire-carbón El circuito de carbón empieza en el parque de homogeneización donde es mezclado como se verá en el apartado de parque de carbones. Mediante cintas transportadoras, se conduce hasta las tolvas de carbón. Existen 12 tolvas de carbón cada una con capacidad de 500 t. De las tolvas, Figura 8. Alimentador volumétrico el carbón cae por gravedad a los alimentadores volumétricos de cinta sinfín (Fig. 8), uno por tolva, los cuales se encargan de enviar el carbón en su cantidad exacta a los molinos. Existen 6 molinos presurizados de bolas cada uno con capacidad de 37,5 t/h de carbón y 72 t de carga de bolas de acero. Del alimentador, el carbón, va a parar al exterior de un cilindro que está dotado de unos tornillos de Arquímedes o sinfines (Fig. 9) que giran Figura 9. Tornillo Arquímedes solidarios al eje del molino y se encarga de introducir el carbón en el tambor del molino. Por la parte interior del eje circula el aire procedente del ventilador de aire primario que se encarga de secar y transportar el carbón hasta los quemadores.

El ventilador de aire primario, aspira aire de la impulsión del Figura 10. Precalentador de aire tipo Rothemule. ventilador de tiro forzado y lo divide en 2 ramas. Una rama va a parar a los precalentadores de aire primario, que se encargan de elevar la temperatura del aire para el secado del carbón y la entrada a la caldera. Los precalentadores son del tipo Rothemule (Fig. 10), su funcionamiento se basa en el intercambio de calor entre los gases producto de la combustión y el aire de admisión, de manera que la campana gira a unas ciertas revoluciones y por su interior circula aire, por la parte exterior circulan los gases de combustión que calientan el aire de admisión a caldera. La otra rama no pasa por los precalentadores de aire primario sino que sirve como aire de atemperación en caso de ser necesario bajar su temperatura. Esta última rama también sirve para el aire de cierre de los molinos que, al ser presurizados, deben estar dotados de un cierre de aire a mayor presión que la del interior del molino para evitar fugas de carbón. El tambor del molino gira gracias a un motor de 955 kW (1300 HP) que gira a unas 995 rpm. Mediante una reductora, se hace girar al tambor a 17,2 rpm. Dicho tambor está dotado de unos tornillos (Fig.11) que favorecen al arrastre de bolas de acero hasta una cierta Figura 11. Tornillos del tambor del molino.

Una vez molido, el carbón sale por la parte superior del molino gracias al aire primario y va a parar a un clasificador que solo deja pasar el carbón totalmente pulverizado, introduciendo de nuevo en el tambor del molino aquel carbón que exceda de tamaño. Desde el clasificador el carbón, va a parar a los quemadores, los cuales son ciclónicos y existen 24, doce quemadores en la pared frontal y otros doce en la pared trasera, es decir 4 quemadores por molino (Fig. 12).

Existe una entrada de aire secundario y otra de aire auxiliar, ubicadas por encima de los quemadores, las cuales favorecen y optimizan la combustión, acabando con un tanto por ciento de exceso de aire. Figura 14. Caldera y elementos. Página 20 Central Térmica de Compostilla Tratamiento de agua de aportación a caldera Figura 15. Esquema tratamiento de agua de admisión a caldera El agua procedente del pantano de Bárcena (agua bruta) se aporta por gravedad o por bombeo a través de la Válvula Automática de Aporte a Tanques (VAAT), a los tanques de agua bruta (TAB). Cada vez que abre ésta válvula, arranca la bomba de hipoclorito sódico dosificando este producto al agua bruta antes de llegar a los tanques. Desde los tanques, se bombea el agua bruta clorada al decantador Acelator empleando una de las dos bombas de agua. En la impulsión de las bombas se encuentra la Válvula Automática de Entrada de Agua (VAEA) a Acelator. El caudal de Página 21 Central Térmica de Compostilla agua a Acelator se mantiene en 50 m3/h en condiciones normales de operación. En caso de mayor demanda de agua es necesario modificar el punto de consigna de la VAEA. El agua bruta entra en la Cámara de Mezcla Rápida (CMR) donde se adiciona el coagulante, (también existe la posibilidad de adicionar hipoclorito sódico, si no ha sido vertido previamente). A continuación entra en el decantador Acelator donde se aditiva floculante y se produce la clarificación del agua por precipitación de los sólidos en suspensión en forma de fangos.

El rebose del Acelator (agua decantada o clarificada) es recogido en tres canales que forman parte del antiguo sistema de clarificación lamelar (SCL) y que actualmente funciona como decantador estático posterior. De estos canales, el agua pasa a los tanques de agua decantada a través de la válvula manual de aislamiento (VMA). Desde los tanques de agua decantada (TAD), el agua se bombea a los filtros a presión empleando dos de las cuatro bombas de agua decantada. El agua atraviesa los tres filtros de arena donde se retienen aquellas partículas de tamaño mayor o igual a 0,6 mm. El agua filtrada pasa a un tanque o arqueta intermedia y de ahí pasa al tanque de agua potable (TAP) y al tanque de agua filtrada, que consta de un sistema de control de nivel que hace arrancar dos de las cuatro bombas de agua decantada cuando el nivel en el tanque de agua filtrada (TAF) llega a la posición media. Las hace parar cuando se alcanza la posición de alto nivel. Del TAF el agua pasa a las cadenas desmineralizadoras impulsada por las bombas de agua decantada para generar agua desmineralizada de aportación al ciclo agua-vapor. Del TAP pasará al filtro de carbón activo impulsada por las bombas de agua potable, para ser distribuida a la red de saneamiento de la U.P.T. (Unión Producción Térmica) Página 22 Central Térmica de Compostilla En Centrales Térmicas es muy importante realizar un tratamiento de agua de aportación a calderas. El tratamiento de agua lo podemos desglosar en dos grupos: • Pretratamiento de agua. • Desmineralización. El pretatamiento de agua está compuesto por las siguientes fases: Desinfección, cuya función es eliminar material orgánico, virus, bacterias y algunos metales como el hierro y el manganeso que estén contenidos en el agua. Clarificación, cuya función es eliminar las materias en suspensión en el agua mediante coagulación, floculación, y sedimentación. Filtración, cuya misión es eliminar los sólidos en suspensión que permanezcan de las etapas anteriores. Desinfección Existen diversos métodos utilizados en centrales industriales, aquí explicaremos el sistema que lleva a cabo la Central. Cloración, consiste en eliminar microorganismos a base de cloro, ya que este se introduce en sus células y los elimina. Además contribuye a la eliminación de metales como el hierro o el manganeso por oxidación: Cloro gaseoso Se comercializa normalmente en botellas de 100Kg o en cilindros de 500-1000Kg, su transporte es presurizado en forma líquida para reducir su volumen.

Hay que decir que son muy peligrosas y necesitan unos cuidados especiales como una regulación Página 23 Central Térmica de Compostilla exhaustiva de la temperatura y en caso de que la demanda de carga de cloro sea muy elevada será necesaria la instalación de unos evaporadores que calienten el cloro para despresurizarlo. Hipoclorito Sódico (NaOCl) También conocido como lejía de blanqueo y contiene entorno a un 12-15% de Cloro aprovechable, que se encuentra diluido. Las instalaciones que utilizan este método son sencillas ya que mediante un sistema de bombeo se aspira del tanque de almacenamiento y se dosifica al agua mediante bombas dosificadoras de caudal variable. Clarificación Proceso físico-químico cuyo objetivo es eliminar las partículas que enturbian el agua, es decir, los sólidos en suspensión, precipitándolos en forma de lodos. El proceso podemos dividirlo en: coagulación, floculación y sedimentación. Existen tres tipos de estados de impurezas en función de su tamaño: • Partículas disueltas: No son filtrables ni sedimentan además de no dispersar la luz (Se eliminan en la desmineralización). • Partículas coloidales: se encuentran en suspensión y no son filtrables. No sedimentan o tardan mucho tiempo. Dispersan la luz. • Partículas en suspensión: Son filtrables y sedimentables. Se ven a simple vista, se eliminan mediante el proceso de cloración. Dispersan la luz. Coagulación Proceso mediante el cual se eliminan las cargas eléctricas de las partículas coloidales. De esta manera se evita la repulsión de los coloides y se facilita su unión. Por tanto es un proceso de neutralización en el cual se aditiva coagulantes, que reaccionan con el coloide, ya que son de distinta carga, y se forman flóculos. Página 24 Central Térmica de Compostilla Los coagulantes más empleados en la Industria son: Sulfato férrico 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹2(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆4)3 Cloruro Férrico 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹2𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶3 Sulfato de Aluminio 𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶2(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆4)3 Policloruro de Aluminio (𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛(𝑆𝑆𝑂𝑂)𝑚𝑚𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶3𝑛𝑛 −𝑚𝑚)𝑥𝑥 La elección dependerá del tipo de agua a tratar así como de la instalación para efectuar el proceso de cloración. Potencial Zeta Es una medida de la magnitud de repulsión o atracción entre partículas. Se utiliza para controlar el proceso de coagulación. El valor normalmente, debe estar entre 30 y -30 mV. Floculación Figura 16. Medidor potencial zeta Proceso mediante el cual se forman aglomeraciones de partículas debido a la existencia de colisiones sucesivas. El proceso consiste en la aditivación de un compuesto floculante polimérico (formado por largas cadenas) al cual se le van adhiriendo los flóculos formados en el proceso de coagulación. De esta manera los flóculos poseen una cierta masa que provocará, en el proceso de decantación, su sedimentación en forma de lodos. Decantación Siguiente proceso en la etapa"

De esta manera los flóculos poseen una cierta masa que provocará, en el proceso de decantación, su sedimentación en forma de lodos. Decantación Siguiente proceso en la etapa de clarificación del agua que consiste en la sedimentación de los sólidos en suspensión en forma de lodos y su separación del agua. Página 25 Central Térmica de Compostilla Existen diversos tipos de decantadores dependiendo de la manera en que circulen el agua en su interior y el sentido de la misma: Decantadores estáticos Decantadores de recirculación de fangos Decantadores de lecho de fango Se procede a la explicación del decantador utilizado por la Central. Decantador Acelator (recirculación de fangos) Figura 17. Decantador Acelator La misión de la de la decantación es eliminar partículas en suspensión por sedimentación. Para poder sedimentar la materia en suspensión se añaden productos químicos al agua (coagulante: policloruro de aluminio y floculante: Nalco 8182) con la finalidad de formar partículas de mayor tamaño (flóculos) que precipiten en forma de lodos. El agua bruta previamente clorada se mezcla con el coagulante en la Cámara de Mezcla Rápida. A continuación el agua entra (1) en las zonas de mezcla (5) y (6) donde se le dosifica el floculante. La agitación o mezcla del reactivo con el agua a tratar debe ser lo suficientemente lenta para impedir la rotura del flóculo formado. Los lodos se separan Página 26 Central Térmica de Compostilla del agua clara en la zona de decantación. El exceso de lodos va precipitándose en la zona de concentración de fangos (9). Cada cierto tiempo se purga el exceso de lodos (10). El agua decantada rebosa al decantador de lamelas (2). Una vez concluida la fase de sedimentación se procede al último proceso de la clarificación, la filtración. Existen diferentes procesos de filtración como: - Filtros a presión - Filtros de carbón activo - Filtros de gravedad - Filtros de cartuchos - Filtros de membrana (microfiltración) Se procede a la explicación de los filtros utilizados por la central: Filtro a presión de arena La función de los tres filtros en serie de arena a presión es eliminar aquellas partículas que aun contenga el agua decantada de tamaño mayor o igual a 0,6mm. Cada filtro tiene 8,04 m3 de superficie de filtración, compuesta por arena. El agua decantada entra al filtro por la válvula superior (F-VA-1) y atraviesa el lecho en sentido descendente, saliendo por la válvula inferior (F-VA-2). El lavado con agua o con aire se realiza en sentido contrario, entra a través de la válvula F- VA-3 y sale por la válvula F-VA-4 hacia la"

Durante el proceso de filtrado en funcionamiento normal sólo funciona una de las cuatro Bombas de Agua Decantada, aportando un caudal máximo de 80 m3/h. Durante el proceso de lavado funcionarán tres, manteniendo una de reserva. El aire de lavado es proporcionado por dos grupos de bombas motosoplantes que impulsa airea través de la válvula F-VA-5. Desmineralización Su función principal radica en la eliminación de sólidos disueltos que contiene el agua de aportación a caldera. Los sólidos disueltos son partículas de tamaño reducido que se encuentran totalmente rodeadas por moléculas de agua y que poseen cierta carga eléctrica. Si la carga es negativa se denominan aniones, en cambio, si la carga es positiva se denominan cationes. Sin la presencia de agua forman compuestos denominados sales. Existen diferentes procesos para la desmineralización del agua: Procesos de destilación, los cuales se basan en la separación de los componentes no volátiles mediante cambios de estado en el agua. Procesos de membrana, los cuales se basan en las propiedades que presentan ciertos tipos de membranas las cuales permiten el paso de moléculas de cierto tamaño a través de sus poros (Ósmosis inversa o electrodiálisis). Procesos de intercambio iónico Proceso utilizado por la Central que tiene lugar cuando un ion de una disolución se intercambia por otro ion de igual signo que se encuentra a una partícula sólida móvil. Los intercambiadores de iones son unas sustancias del tipo granular insoluble, denominadas resinas, que contienen en su estructura grupos ácidos y básicos y son capaces de cambiar dichos iones por otros iones, eso sí, del mismo signo. En primer lugar, el agua pasa por una resina de intercambio catiónico donde quedan retenidos los cationes y se incorporan al agua iones hidrógeno ( . En segundo lugar, + el agua, va a parar a una resina de intercambio aniónico donde quedan retenidos los 𝑂𝑂 ) Página 28 Central Térmica de Compostilla aniones y se incorporan iones hidroxilo al agua ( .

Una vez realizada la introducción de los procesos que ocurren en la desmineralización, se continúa con la explicación del circuito que se lleva a cabo en la Central. Figura 19. Esquema Desmineralización Página 29 Central Térmica de Compostilla Circuito agua desmineralizada El agua filtrada contenida en el tanque de agua filtrada es impulsada hacia las cadenas a través de cuatro bombas de agua filtrada. Estas bombas son centrífugas horizontales, con un caudal nominal de 73 m3/h. Cada bomba de agua filtrada aspira del depósito mediante pasamuros. Al estar en carga, entre el pasamuros y las bridas de aspiración se ha instalado una válvula de aislamiento. La tubería de impulsión de cada bomba consta de una válvula de retención y una válvula manual de aislamiento. Las cuatro tuberías de impulsión se unen en un colector común. Con objeto de proteger las cadenas ante un aumento de presión se ha instalado en este colector una válvula de seguridad tarada a 8 kg/cm2. Este colector principal llega a los tres filtros de carbón activo instalados en paralelo. Cada filtro va asociado a una cadena de desmineralización, pero gracias a juegos de válvulas se puede hacer que un filtro alimente a cualquiera de los lechos de resinas. La instalación de desmineralización consta de tres cadenas idénticas, dispuestas en paralelo, con capacidad unitaria neta de 70 m3/h. Cada cadena está formada por un Catexer (Fig.20) y un Anexer (Fig.21), instalados en serie, que constituirán la desmineralización primaria. El método de funcionamiento elegido es mediante lechos fluidizados, debido a su menor consumo de regenerantes y una menor fuga de iones del agua tratada. Durante la fase de servicio, el agua tratada penetra por la parte inferior del depósito. Su principal característica es su funcionamiento a contracorriente, es decir, regeneran en sentido contrario al de servicio. Página 30 Central Térmica de Compostilla Figura 20. Lecho catiónico de flujo ascendente. Los aditivos regenerantes utilizados son ácido sulfúrico en concentración adecuada para el Catexer y sosa cáustica para el Anexer. Por tanto la instalación dispondrá de un circuito de regeneración, que constará de tanques de almacenamiento de productos, bombas de trasvase, de adicción y de dilución, y una estación reguladora de Figura 21. Lechos aniónicos con flujo ascendente y descendente. Página 31 Central Térmica de Compostilla concentración y temperatura de las disoluciones regenerantes.

El procedimiento a seguir, del soplador, empieza introduciendo en el hogar una lanza en cuyo extremo se ubica una tobera de inyección de vapor, su recorrido es corto, quedando la lanza en su máxima penetración en posiciones muy cercanas a la pared. La tobera está orientada de forma que el chorro de vapor lama la pared. A la vez que sopla, la lanza va girando sobre su eje, de forma que el chorro va limpiando un gran círculo de la pared alrededor del punto de entrada de la lanza. Están constituidos esencialmente por (Fig.23): • Un motor eléctrico que introduce la boquilla en la caldera, a través de una reductora, realizando la operación de soplado (380V, 50Hz). • Una lanza cuyo final es una boquilla de soplado, la cual se introduce en el hogar. • Una válvula de alimentación de vapor, que se encarga de la admisión"

Página 59 Central Térmica de Compostilla Sopladores retráctiles de medio retroceso (semirretráctiles) Se emplean para limpiar la salida de los pasos de gases del sobrecalentador y del recalentador, y el economizador inferior. Los modelos empleados para los sopladores semirretráctiles son: • 8 sopladores CLYDE MK 435/HT/E. Durante el avance y retroceso la lanza gira en el mismo sentido y el chorro de vapor sale por la lanza en dirección perpendicular al eje de la misma por las dos boquillas situadas en el medio de la caña y en la punta. Las toberas del medio de la caña quedan muy cerca de la pared en posición de reposo del soplador. La diferencia esencial entre los sopladores retráctiles y los semirretráctiles o de medio retroceso radica en la posición de ubicación y, por lo tanto, en su funcionamiento. No es necesaria extraer la totalidad de la lanza debido a la menor temperatura de los gases en la ubicación de dichos sopladores. La diferencia entre los sopladores retráctiles, de retroceso total, y los semirretráctiles, de medio retroceso, estriba en que en estos últimos, en su posición de reposo, la mitad de la lanza queda dentro de la caldera, ya que al estar ubicados en zonas de temperaturas algo más bajas (salida de los pasos de gases del sobrecalentador y del recalentador, y el economizador inferior), no hay peligro de que se doble la lanza.

Sopladores de precalentadores Son los encargados de limpiar depósitos de cenizas de las placas de los precalentadores y así evitar su posible riesgo de incendio. Hay dos sopladores por cada precalentador, tanto de aire primario como de aire secundario, uno para el lado frío del estator y otro para el lado caliente. Los sopladores están fijos al chasis de la campana, girando con ésta. El soplador del lado inferior se ha dispuesto desplazado 180° con respecto al soplador de la parte superior. Página 60 Central Térmica de Compostilla Cada soplador consta de una tubería de soplado horizontal. La tubería tiene un movimiento radial hacia atrás y hacia adelante por medio de un accionamiento tipo manivela (2) que a su vez toma el movimiento del volante giratorio (3). Este volante está provisto de un determinado número de espigas que golpean en una varilla de accionamiento (4) fija al conducto de gases, cada vez que pasa la rueda junto a ella, produciendo el movimiento del volante. La varilla de accionamiento está normalmente en posición extraída, introduciéndose automáticamente mediante un motor situado en el exterior del precalentador, cuando se pone en servicio el sistema de soplado. • Los sopladores de los precalentadores de aire primario consisten en una especie de rastrillo compuesto por un tubo horizontal con agujeros (49 toberas de 5 mm.), el cual se fija a la campana en la parte de gas. El consumo de un soplador es de 3.100 Kg/h de vapor sobrecalentado a 6 Kg/cm2. El periodo de soplado es de 15 minutos. • Los sopladores de los precalentadores de aire secundario son también una especie de rastrillo con 7 toberas de 17 mm. de diámetro. El consumo de un soplador es de 3.325 Kg/h de vapor sobrecalentado a 6 Kg/cm2. El tiempo de soplado es de 30 minutos. Página 61 Central Térmica de Compostilla Figura 28.

    "text": "de rotación. En la central térmica el fluido de trabajo de la turbina es vapor, generado por una caldera acuotubular que utiliza como combustible carbón pulverizado. El vapor generado en la caldera posee una temperatura y una presión elevadas, es decir, una elevada entalpia al llegar a la turbina. En la turbina el vapor se expande, donde reduce su presión y temperatura. Esta diferencia de entalpias que sufre el vapor, a causa de su expansión, podríamos decir que es la energía que la turbina ha podido transformar en movimiento rotacional en su eje (salto entálpico). La turbina consta de una parte fija y otra móvil. El rotor es el órgano móvil el cual consta de un eje donde van albergadas las ruedas de álabes de manera concéntrica y estratégicamente distribuidas a lo largo de su longitud. Entre las ruedas de álabes o rodetes del rotor van ubicadas las coronas o diafragmas fijos que están constituidos por una serie de álabes fijos que sirven como directrices del vapor entre los distintos álabes móviles. Van insertados en una carcasa formando el estator. Para un correcto funcionamiento así como para una adecuada regulación y seguridad la turbina debe constar de: • Válvulas de control así como de paro de emergencia de la turbina. • Sistemas de aceite de engrase y regulación. • Sistemas de protección contra: - Velocidad excesiva. - Pérdidas de aceite de engrase de cojinetes. - Pérdida de vacío. - Desgaste del cojinete o chumacera de empuje. Página 63 Central Térmica de Compostilla Análisis La central posee una turbina, llamada así de forma genérica, ya que en realidad consta de dos cuerpos, un cuerpo de alta presión y otro cuerpo de baja presión, comunicados entre sí mediante tubos de intercomunicación denominados crossover, tal y como podemos Figura 29. Conjunto Excitatriz-Alternador-TBP-TAP apreciar en la figura 29. En el cuerpo de alta presión, a su vez, podemos diferenciar una etapa Curtis y tres cuerpos de alta presión; la turbina de alta presión (AP), la turbina de presión intermedia alta (PIA) y la turbina de presión intermedia baja (PIB). La turbina de alta presión está formada por una doble carcasa o envolvente, de manera que mientras la corona porta álabes de la turbina de presión intermedia baja (PIB) está soportada por la carcasa exterior, las coronas porta álabes de las turbinas de (AP) y Presión Intermedia alta (PIA) están soportadas por la carcasa interior. Como el vapor que circula entre las dos carcasas tiene una cierta presión y temperatura, las condiciones de trabajo de la carcasa interior se ven facilitadas, no teniendo que Figura 30.

Cuerpo de la turbina Página 64 Central Térmica de Compostilla soportar altas diferencias de presiones y temperaturas entre el interior y exterior. En la turbina de Baja Presión (BP) el flujo de vapor queda dividido en dos partes iguales, doble flujo o doble trayectoria de álabes, duplicándose así la sección de paso, evitando la construcción de ruedas excesivamente grandes y álabes excesivamente largos, al mismo tiempo esta disposición logra que los empujes axiales del vapor resulten equilibrados en esta turbina. Funcionamiento El vapor procedente de la caldera en condiciones de 162 Kg/cm2 de presión y 535°C, llega a la sala de turbinas por la tubería de vapor principal y cerca de la máquina se divide en dos Figura 31. Válvulas de estrangulación ramas, que alcanzan las válvulas de estrangulación (VE), situadas una al lado derecho y otra al lado izquierdo. Desde las válvulas de estrangulación (Fig.31), el vapor pasa a sendas cajas de vapor y a las correspondientes válvulas de control (VC). Desde las válvulas de control (Fig.32) y por los espaguetis, penetra el vapor a la cámara de toberas, en cuyo extremo se encuentran las toberas de expansión de la primera Figura 32 Válvulas de control turbina. Página 65 Central Térmica de Compostilla Figura 33. Toberas de entrada etapa Curtis. Esta primera turbina consta de dos ruedas móviles de acción que constituyen dos escalonamientos de velocidad, denominada etapa Curtis (Fig.33). Desde la etapa Curtis pasa a la turbina de alta presión (AP). El vapor de escape de la turbina de (AP), llamado también vapor recalentado frío (VRF), se recoge en una cámara conectada a las tuberías que posteriormente se reúnen en una tubería mayor. En esa tubería y próxima a la turbina, se encuentra la válvula de retención controlada, impuesta por el by-pass de turbina para la protección de la misma. Este vapor de escape de (AP) se conduce a la caldera, donde se recalienta Página 66 Central Térmica de Compostilla hasta 535°C. Se envía de nuevo a la sala de turbinas, con el nombre de vapor recalentado caliente (VRC), por una tubería que se divide en dos ramas, alcanzando la turbomáquina a través de sendas válvulas, llamadas válvulas de parada de recalentado (VPR). Estas van seguidas de las válvulas interceptoras (VI). Desde las válvulas interceptoras (Fig.34), el vapor es conducido a la cámara y posteriormente entra en la turbina de presión intermedia alta (PIA). Su escape es conducido a la admisión Figura 34.

Su escape es conducido a la admisión Figura 34. Válvulas interceptoras. de la turbina de presión intermedia baja (PIB), cuya salida se dirige, por dos grandes tuberías de intercomunicación muy visibles sobre la máquina, a la turbina de baja presión. Esta última consta a su vez de dos turbinas simétricas, es decir, es de doble flujo. Los escapes de la turbina de (BP) se recogen en una gran carcasa que dirige el vapor al condensador, situado debajo. En el condensador los haces tubulares recorridos por agua fría condensan el vapor para volver a iniciar de nuevo todo el proceso. Se sabe que en el condensador existe un cierto grado de vacío (650 mm Hg) por lo que podemos suponer que en algún momento en el paso del vapor por la turbina de baja, tendremos una presión menor que la atmosférica. El punto donde se encuentra la zona de transición de presiones viene determinado por la carga. Cuanto menor sea la carga, la zona de transición estará más alejada del condensador. El vapor proveniente de la caldera, a una presión muy elevada, ejerce una fuerza sobre cada álabe que provoca el movimiento de los elementos móviles de la turbina y por otra parte crea un empuje axial. Las primeras ruedas móviles, están diseñadas para soportar dicho empuje axial mientras que las posteriores ruedas móviles dan como Página 67 Central Térmica de Compostilla resultado un par en el eje que es capaz de vencer cierta resistencia que se oponga a su giro. El par resistente que se opone al avance del eje de la turbina, es el producido por el alternador e incrementa en función de la cantidad de energía que transforma el alternador, ya que es la turbina la que genera el movimiento en el mismo. Si la turbina no tuviera ese par resistente, incrementaría su velocidad de giro exponencialmente hasta el punto de su empalamiento. Virador Es el conjunto formado por un motor eléctrico y un reductor de engranajes, el cual mediante un embrague, tiene la función de acoplarse al eje de la turbina para hacerle girar a unas 3 rpm. El virador se pone en funcionamiento en las operaciones de parada y Figura 35. Virador arranque de la turbina por diversas razones: • En el momento de la parada, la turbina, pasa de una elevada temperatura a temperatura ambiente.

Para que la disminución del gradiente de temperatura sea uniforme en todos los elementos de la turbina, ya sean álabes, toberas, paletas o cierres, el virador no permite el paro completo de la misma ya que debido a la diferencia de altura en el cuerpo de la turbina, los calorifugados y las grandes masas metálicas de los elementos, se producirían deformaciones. Durante el enfriamiento, las partes más elevadas del cuerpo de la turbina se conservan más calientes que las zonas bajas, provocando diversos grados de Página 68 Central Térmica de Compostilla dilataciones dependiendo de la altura de los elementos, lo cual provoca curvaturas y distorsiones en el rotor. Sin embargo al mantener una velocidad constante, el enfriamiento se producirá de una manera uniforme. • En la etapa de enfriamiento, se puede dar el caso que por algún drenaje se introduzca vapor procedente de las tuberías, el cual se dirigiría a la parte alta de los cilindros provocando los inconvenientes nombrados anteriormente. • En operaciones de arranque también es aconsejable poner en funcionamiento el virador e imprescindible cuando se empieza a introducir vapor a los cierres, para lograr un calentamiento uniforme. El virador está comandado por una válvula de solenoide, lubricado por aceite mediante una bomba centrífuga y tiene la capacidad de desembragarse por sí mismo, al llegar a una cierta velocidad (Fig.36). Figura 36. Embrague virador. Página 69 Central Térmica de Compostilla Turbobomba de agua de alimentación Turbina El accionamiento de la turbina se realiza tomando vapor de la etapa media/alta de la turbina principal (extracción 4, corresponde a la que va al desgasificador) o del vapor recalentado frío. Entra a través de las válvulas de cierre o aislamiento (2) a la válvula de regulación (caja de vapor) con 8 toberas de salida. De ellas va a las ruedas de álabes o coronas (5) y, totalmente expansionado, al condensador principal. Gira a una velocidad aproximada de 5.000 rpm, por lo que no es necesaria una etapa variadora de velocidad entre ésta y la bomba. Como la velocidad de la turbina se regula variando el caudal de vapor que se aporta, tampoco es necesario un control de velocidad externo. Por lo tanto, el acoplamiento entre turbina y bomba es directo, a través del eje. La turbina está apoyada sobre dos cojinetes, llevando además un cojinete de empuje en el lado opuesto a la bomba (pedestal) para absorber los esfuerzos axiales.

La disposición de estas turbinas es de una serie de ruedas colocadas sobre un eje común, a poca distancia una de otra, y en cuya periferia van montadas las paletas y separadas por unos diafragmas en los que van dispuestas las toberas. Estos diafragmas van encastrados por su periferia al estator, de forma que sea fácil su montaje y desmontaje, y disponiendo en el paso del eje de adecuados obturadores para evitar las fugas de vapor de una a otra región del diafragma.

Bomba principal Las etapas de la bomba principal son las siguientes: • Etapa intermedia: con presión de impulsión reducida, para sprays de control de temperatura del vapor recalentado. • 5 etapas de impulsión normal al circuito de agua alimentación. Las etapas 1, 2, y 3 montadas en sentido opuesto a los 4 y 5 para contrarrestar empujes axiales. • Etapa extra para atemperación del vapor para sprays inferiores y superiores.

La descarga de la bomba es el punto del circuito de mayor presión en toda la Térmica. A partir de aquí el agua (y después el vapor) van perdiendo presión paulatinamente. La presión del agua de alimentación debe ser tal que nos permita vencer las diversas caídas de presión que se producen en el circuito e introducir el agua en el calderín. Figura 38. Bomba principal.

(altura neta de succión positiva, parámetro que determina que no exista cavitación) de la bomba de agua de alimentación, se suele instalar una bomba de refuerzo o BOOSTER.

Página 73 Central Térmica de Compostilla Cálculo Rendimiento del Ciclo Para realizar el cálculo del rendimiento del ciclo, debemos calcular en primera instancia su consumo específico. Para ello, debemos conocer el caudal de agua de alimentación a caldera cuyo valor se obtiene realizando el balance de energía en los calentadores de agua así como el balance másico en el desgasificador-bomba. Es un ciclo Rankine Regenerativo (en cascada) con recalentamiento intermedio de seis extracciones. Según el código ASME PTC-6.1 y las consideraciones de la empresa Endesa, el cálculo del consumo específico se realizara utilizando 3 extracciones; los calentadores de alta presión 5 y 6 y el desgasificador o calentador de baja presión número 4. Podemos apreciar el sistema de extracciones y el sistema de calentadores de agua de admisión a caldera en la siguiente figura.

En rasgos generales está compuesto por: • Inducido (estator): constituido por unas bobinas donde se generan fuerzas electromagnéticas al cambiar de posición el campo magnético al que se ven sometidas cuando gira el inductor. • Inductor (rotor): crea un campo magnético producido por electroimanes alimentados por la corriente de excitación. Figura 41. Excitatriz-Alternador Página 82 Central Térmica de Compostilla Estator Se construye de forma hermética para facilitar la refrigeración por hidrógeno en su interior, sin permitir el escape de éste a la atmósfera. Está integrado por los siguientes elementos: • Carcasa. • Núcleo magnético. • Bobinados. • Refrigerantes. • Bornes de salida. Rotor El rotor está formado por un cilindro de acero forjado formando un cuerpo único en el que va bobinado el inductor. Tiene dos polos y gira a 3.000 rpm dentro del estator. La velocidad (frecuencia) y la potencia (potencia activa) del alternador se regulan mediante la actuación sobre la regulación de la turbina. La tensión y la potencia reactiva generadas se regulan mediante el control de excitación (regulación de la intensidad de excitación). Está integrado por: • Eje. • Bobinados. • Anillos de retención. • Turboventilador. Página 83 Central Térmica de Compostilla Turboventilador Va montado en el extremo del eje del rotor que conecta con la turbina y tiene como función impulsar la circulación de hidrógeno en el interior del alternador. Está formado por: • Álabes móviles solidarios con el rotor. • Álabes fijos solidarios al estator. El hidrógeno que impulsa el ventilador atraviesa unos refrigerantes de hidrógeno desde donde, una vez frío, realiza la refrigeración de los distintos componentes del alternador. Página 84 Central Térmica de Compostilla Refrigeración alternador Un alternador transforma la energía mecánica que produce una turbina en energía eléctrica. Durante el proceso de transformación de energía, se producen pérdidas de calor tanto en el cobre como en el hierro. Para solventarlo se utiliza una atmósfera de hidrógeno, la cual también sirve como refrigeración del alternador. Ventajas de refrigeración mediante Hidrógeno: • Las pérdidas de ventilación y de fricción por el giro del rotor son menores, debido a su baja densidad. Las pérdidas por ventilación son proporcionales a la densidad del gas. • Se logra mayor potencia por unidad de volumen debido a los coeficientes de transmisión de calor que tiene el hidrógeno y a su alta conductividad térmica frente al aire. • Los gastos de mantenimiento son menores, debido a que el sistema cerrado de circulación de gas impide la formación de polvo y humedades. • La vida del aislamiento del arrollamiento del estator es más larga al no haber oxígeno ni humedad. • Por la menor densidad del gas y por"

El problema que se nos presenta es que el hidrógeno es un gas combustible que forma una mezcla explosiva con el aire si su porcentaje en el volumen de la mezcla se encuentra dentro del rango de 5 - 70%.

    "text": "Figura 44. Rueda de diodos. la excitatriz se rectifica mediante un puente de diodos que gira solidario con el rotor y se introduce como excitación principal en el alternador. En cuanto a la regulación, en un alternador sólo cabe hablar de la corriente de excitación, pues la regulación de otras variables que afectan al funcionamiento de la máquina (velocidad, par, factor de potencia, etc.) no se efectúan sobre el propio generador, sino que vienen impuestas. El par entregado por la turbina es el demandado por la carga, de forma que el regulador de turbina se encarga de mantener la velocidad constante. Por otra parte, la velocidad viene impuesta por la frecuencia de la red al estar el alternador acoplado y en sincronismo con ella. El factor de potencia también viene impuesto por la carga, y lo único que se puede regular en el alternador es la tensión generada o la potencia reactiva entregada. La regulación se consigue mediante los tiristores del cajón de potencia, que al abrir más o menos dejan llegar una tensión variable a la excitatriz y, con ello, aumentar o disminuir la intensidad de la excitación principal. A continuación podemos observar las características de los elementos que constituyen la excitatriz.

La función del precipitador electrostático o electrofiltro, consiste en la retención de las partículas en suspensión que existen en los gases resultantes de la combustión, para evitar que estas partículas salgan con los gases a través de la chimenea a la atmósfera. Estas partículas en suspensión existentes en los gases y separadas de los mismos en el electrofiltro se conocen como cenizas volantes. El precipitador electrostático se basa en el principio de ionización, es decir, en el hecho de que en el interior de un campo eléctrico las partículas de ceniza se cargan eléctricamente. Para ello, los gases se hacen pasar por el interior de una cámara donde se crea un campo electrostático establecido entre los electrodos emisores o de descarga (negativos) y los electrodos colectores o placas (positivos), conectados a tierra. Los gases al pasar por los electrodos emisores se cargan negativamente gracias al principio de ionización y al pasar por los electrodos colectores son atraídos debido a su distinta carga eléctrica. El máximo campo electrostático se genera en la proximidad de los electrodos de descarga o emisores, ionizando a las partículas de ceniza (Fig.45). Figura 45. Principio de ionización. El electrofiltro está constituido por una cámara dividida en pasillos paralelos formados por placas colectoras"

Página 89 Central Térmica de Compostilla El electrofiltro está dividido en dos mitades, separadas la una de la otra a prueba de gases, para facilitar el acceso para efectuar reparaciones, sin parar el precipitador. Cada mitad recoge los gases de una de las dos salidas de la caldera y los gases limpios son arrastrados por un ventilador de tiro inducido que los envía a la chimenea. A su vez, cada mitad se divide en una serie de campos o secciones separadas en serie. Cada campo está equipado con un transformador/rectificador alimentado con baja tensión, situado en el techo del precipitador. Las partículas de ceniza acumuladas sobre las superficies de las placas colectoras son periódicamente desprendidas de ellas mediante un sistema de golpeadores y recogidas en las tolvas del precipitador. Figura 46. Precipitador electrostático. Página 90 Central Térmica de Compostilla Electrodos emisores Los electrodos de descarga o emisores de diversas formas se aplican de acuerdo con las propiedades físicas de los gases que haya que limpiarse. Con los carbones de antracita, por ejemplo, suelen emplearse exclusivamente electrodos con puntas de descarga, ya que las cenizas producidas en los hogares de cenicero húmedo tienen una conductividad muy baja con lo que la ionización necesaria del gas y la consiguiente carga del polvo se obtiene con este tipo de electrodos. La ventaja de este tipo de alambres de descarga, si se compara con los alambres de púas, está en la mejora de la capacidad de vibración. Por otra parte, esta forma no ofrece a las partículas tantas posibilidades de amontonamiento, por lo que la limpieza de los electrodos de descarga es segura incluso durante largos periodos de funcionamiento. Si se utiliza el lignito como combustible, los electrodos utilizados, aparte de los hilos con puntas de descarga, tienen la sección transversal en forma de estrella. En este caso se procede de forma que se dispongan en primer lugar los electrodos de descarga con puntas de descarga a la entrada de cada zona de separación, mientras que el resto del campo está equipado con alambres en forma de estrella. Los alambres de descarga se ensartan en bastidores tubulares con sus correspondientes cuñas. Además los extremos de los alambres se aseguran mediante procesos de soldadura.

Además los extremos de los alambres se aseguran mediante procesos de soldadura. Electrodos colectores Las placas colectoras se construyen normalmente en chapas metálicas laminadas en frío. Su sección se diseña de modo que produzca una gran estabilidad de forma así como un buen comportamiento vibratorio. Estas propiedades se consiguen mediante múltiples repliegues practicados en el centro del electrodo y mediante ranuras en los lados a lo largo del mismo, estando abiertas hacia un solo lado. Además estas ranuras actúan como defensas del flujo, evitando que las partículas ya separadas vuelvan a entrar en el flujo de gases. Página 91 Central Térmica de Compostilla Sistema de golpeo Las partículas de ceniza ionizadas positivamente en la proximidad del electrodo, se depositan sobre éste reduciendo la intensidad del campo eléctrico. Con el sistema de golpeo se produce periódicamente el desprendimiento de la capa de cenizas depositadas que van a parar a las tolvas de almacenamiento del propio precipitador. Los electrodos o alambres de descarga se limpian con mecanismos de golpeo por gravedad a los que se les denomina martillos. Éstos son construidos en fundición de acero con brazos articulados, van montados sobre un eje que gira lentamente, golpeando los yunques de las barras de golpeo alternativamente y por gravedad. Los martillos golpean en dirección normal a los electrodos consiguiendo una limpieza realmente profunda. Hay que decir que en función de la demanda de carga, el tipo de central y el tipo de combustible utilizado, el precipitador variará en su diseño y en sus elementos, pero el funcionamiento se basa en el mismo principio.

Para eliminar los óxidos de azufre, el grupo, posee una planta de desulfuración la cual se detalla a continuación: 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆2 Estructura Se puede decir que la planta está dividida en 2 partes paralelas separadas entre ellas donde los gases en primera instancia pasan a la parte inferior, donde se encuentra ubicado el absorbedor.

El BUF se encarga de enviar los gases de combustión a la parte superior de la planta lugar en el que se encuentra el intercambiador de calor gas- gas. La planta posee un conducto bypass el cual se acciona mediante un damper bypass (compuerta bypass) para tratar el 100% del gas de combustión de la caldera, de manera que ésta no se fuerza al estar cerrada debido a un fallo de la planta. El gas de combustión tiene un sistema de bypass completo cerrando la entrada de gases y las salidas damper, existe también la posibilidad de operación parcial del bypass. El damper bypass se instala en el conducto bypass y se cierra en condiciones normales de operación para prevenir que el gas no tratado salga directamente de la planta sin el tratamiento de eliminación del . 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆2 Los dampers de bypass y de entrada gases se accionan mediante aire de instrumentación proporcionado desde el sistema de servicios. El damper tipo guillotina (damper guillotina de entrada gases, damper de salida gases y damper de entrada de chimenea) se accionan mediante un motor eléctrico. (Se pueden visualizar los dampers en color amarillo en la siguiente figura). Página 94 Central Térmica de Compostilla Durante avería de la planta, puede existir flujo contrario de gas tratado desde una unidad a otra ya que el gas de combustión de ambos grupos 4 y 5 se descarga en una chimenea común. Para prevenir este fenómeno, se instala un damper de entrada en la chimenea y se cierra durante le parada de la planta. Figura 48. Plantas de desulfuración grupos IV y V y dampers.

La pared interior del área de interfaz seca y húmeda (área de contacto del gas de combustión y de la lechada) se lava intermitentemente con agua bombeada desde el tanque de proceso para evitar la formación de depósito.

Los silos se aislarán térmicamente para Figura 52. Entrada sistema JAS mantener el interior seco y evitar la absorción de agua en la caliza. La caliza pulverizada se transfiere a dos tanques de alimentación de lechada mediante cintas transportadoras. El agua filtrada producida en las unidades de deshidratación se alimenta a los tanques para su mezcla con caliza y de esta manera producir lechada. El tanque de alimentación de lechada se aislará térmicamente para protección personal por quemadura. La concentración de lechada en el tanque se ajusta con agua filtrada. La frecuencia de alimentación de agua está en proporción al porcentaje de caliza alimentada para obtener una lechada de piedra caliza del 30 % en peso (15 % en peso de lechada de cal). La lechada se alimenta al absorbedor mediante bombas y va a parar a diversas ubicaciones de la torre. Una parte de la lechada se introduce mediante unas grandes bombas de eyección (Fig.53) que impulsan la lechada en dirección ascendente para facilitar la reacción con los gases Figura 53.

Básculas cual se le facilita a cada proveedor el lugar de descarga y quedan grabados sus datos para así tener un mayor control de las diferentes cargas. Una vez cumplimentado el proceso se dirigen hacia los tomamuestras, los cuales hay de dos tipos: El primero consta de una máquina que posee un largo cilindro que se introduce en el camión Figura 59. Tomamuestras para succionar cierta Página 105 Central Térmica de Compostilla cantidad de carbón para su posterior analizado. Se realiza una primera succión que se devuelve al camión para evitar la mezcla de carbones de anteriores muestras. Seguidamente la máquina realiza tres succiones de carbón de Figura 60. Báscula muestreo cierta cantidad cada una y en diferentes ubicaciones del camión para intentar muestrear de una manera más eficiente. La muestra una vez recogida, pasa a una cinta sinfín donde se deposita en una báscula (Fig.60) la cual determina la cantidad de carbón recogido a pequeños golpes para no pasarse del peso elegido que esta alrededor de los 1,5 Kg. El carbón sobrante del muestreo se coloca en el siguiente camión una vez recogida la muestra para evitar mezclas. Una vez recogida la muestra va a parar a una máquina encargada de embolsar, mediante unas resistencias que se encargan de cortar y pegar la bolsa (100-150°C). En la parte inferior, la máquina, posee una impresora encargada de etiquetar la muestra dependiendo del tipo de carbón y del proveedor. Página 106 Central Térmica de Compostilla El otro método para realizar el muestreo, más eficiente y más rápido, consta de una tolva, en la cual el camión deposita toda la carga, parte de ella se hace pasar por un tanque que, mediante un cucharón, recoge muestras del carbón. El carbón de la tolva es Figura 61. Tanque muestreo. depositado en una cinta sinfín encargada de distribuir el carbón a los diferentes grupos de la central, el carbón sobrante del tanque de muestreo (Fig. 61) va a parar a la misma cinta sinfín. Una vez recogida la muestra, se procede al mismo procedimiento y misma maquinaria para realizar el embolsado y etiquetado que en el primer procedimiento (Fig. 62). También se ha visto el punto de descarga del tren el cual posee unas esclusas en la parte inferior que se abren Figura 62. Máquina embolsado. dejando caer el carbón a unas tolvas"

Otro punto de descarga de carbón son las rejillas de emergencia situadas a ras de suelo por donde cae el carbón y va a parar a cintas que lo transportan al sitio conveniente. Página 107 Central Térmica de Compostilla Este método no se rige por ser de emergencia, puede ser utilizado a conveniencia de la central, pero su uso es menos frecuente. Cada proveedor tiene un lugar asociado para su descarga a fin de agilizar el proceso. Una vez descargado y tomada la muestra, el carbón es enviado a diferentes cribas, dependiendo del lugar de descarga, mediante Figura 63. Recogedora 1000 t/h cintas sinfín. Se hace pasar por un detector de metales que analiza la existencia de los mismos. También existen medidores de tamaño del carbón que se encargan de expulsar el carbón que no cumple con el tamaño pertinente. La central recibe al día unas 15.000 toneladas de carbón y entre los 4 grupos operativos consume alrededor de las 11.000 toneladas diarias. El siguiente paso ha sido visitar las parvas de carbón. Existen cuatro parvas pero una de ellas carece de recogedoras y apiladoras con lo que para su distribución se tiene que transportar a alguna de las otras tres parvas, mediante camiones y cintas sinfín. Hay dos tipos de recogedoras y apiladoras que detallaremos a continuación: - Recogedora de capacidad de 1000 t/h situada en la parva 2-1 (Fig. 63). Está sustentada mediante ruedas ubicadas en raíles que recorren toda la parva paralelamente a fin de poder recoger toda la carga. Dichas ruedas poseen motores eléctricos que permiten el desplazamiento de la máquina. Página 108 Central Térmica de Compostilla Mediante unos brazos que poseen una especie de varillas y se mueven como una cinta sinfín, provocan el desprendimiento del carbón de la parte superior a la inferior para poder ser recogido. Figura 64. Recogedora 2000 t/h Para ello la recogedora posee un gran tambor que gira de manera circular y se mueve de un lado a otro de la parva. El tambor contiene unos cangilones que recogen el carbón y lo depositan, a través de unos orificios practicados en el tambor, en una cinta sinfín colocada de manera perpendicular a los raíles, que se encarga de su distribución.

El objetivo es el mismo y también está sustentada mediante ruedas ubicadas en raíles a lo largo de la parva, pero se realiza de manera diferente. Gracias a un brazo de forma triangular con cierto número de varillas, el carbón cae a la parte inferior de la parva y, en este caso, existe un mecanismo que mediante unos cangilones arrastra el carbón de oeste a este de la parva para hacerlo llegar a una cinta sinfín para su posterior distribución. Tanto el movimiento longitudinal de las recogedoras como el movimiento de los brazos, el de los tambores y mecanismos de recogida son accionados por motores eléctricos. Para alimentarse de electricidad poseen unas grandes ruedas que contienen los cables de alimentación de 6000V. Página 109 Central Térmica de Compostilla Apiladora de 1000 t/h que basa su funcionamiento en una cinta sinfín que deja caer el carbón sobre las parvas. Es capaz de girar 180º con el fin de alimentar a las parvas 2-2 y 2-1. (Fig. 65) Apiladora de 2000 t/h que Figura 65. Apiladora 1000 t/h realiza el mismo procedimiento que la anterior con la diferencia de que es capaz de doblar el caudal de carbón depositado. Alimenta las parvas 1-1 y 1-2. Las recogedoras y apiladoras de mayor potencia normalmente son utilizadas para los grupos 4 y 5 que son los de mayor consumo de carbón. Hay que tener en cuenta los fallos que se puedan producir tanto en las cintas de distribución como en las máquinas encargadas del apilamiento y recogida, por ello las cintas están comunicadas con el fin de que desde cualquier punto del parque de carbones se pueda alimentar a cualquier grupo operativo en caso de fallo así como cintas por duplicado para el abastecimiento de los Figura 66.

En cambio los grupos 3,4 y 5 que poseen plantas de desulfuración, no necesitan antracita sino que se mezcla el carbón nacional con coque con una relación de 89% carbón nacional y 11% de coque. Dichas mezclas se realizan en los parques de homogeneización, parvas 1-1 y 1-2, mediante apiladoras. Para acabar decir que todos los procesos son de manera automática y son controlados desde la sala de control del parque de carbones. Figura 67. Parva homogeneización Página 111 Central Térmica de Compostilla Mantenimiento predictivo En el mantenimiento predictivo es necesario conocer el estado de los ítems a mantener, para detectar el fallo cuando este se encuentra en estado incipiente y poder decidir si es necesaria la intervención del mantenimiento y el poder, además, determinar el momento adecuado para realizar las actividades de mantenimiento sobre dichos ítems, para ello se aplican diversas técnicas analíticas que permitan diagnosticar los fallos cuando todavía no ha producido efectos notables en el comportamiento del equipo, entre las que se encuentran también los ensayos no destructivos (END). • Tiene la responsabilidad de que se realicen todos los procedimientos requeridos para una correcta medición de los elementos, para así poder realizar un correcto mantenimiento predictivo, gracias al historial de las mediciones producidas y almacenadas en programas de ordenador. • Este departamento también se encarga del equilibrado de los ejes. En ocasiones, cuando el eje de un motor se acopla a una reductora, existe cierta facilidad de que el eje no esté en su posición idónea sino que posea un cierto ángulo. También en el caso del eje de la turbina que debido a la cuña de aceite, formada en alguna parte entre el cojinete y el eje, tienda a desplazar el eje en una dirección o cualquier fuerza que también tienda a moverlo. La turbina, para estos casos, posee unos orificios en los álabes donde se introducen unos pesos roscados a fin de contrarrestar la fuerza ejercida que intenta desplazar el eje. Para ello se realizan gráficos polares, teniendo en cuenta la fase, para saber con exactitud en qué ubicación irán los pesos a introducir, ya que no siempre es en el lado opuesto a la fuerza. • Este departamento también se encarga de programar las revisiones de los grupos Página 112 Central Térmica de Compostilla Algunas maquinas especialmente"

El sistema de seguimiento recibe información de uno o varios sensores, calculando continuamente las tendencias de los parámetros monitorizados y llegando incluso a determinar el paro si se cumplen las condiciones preestablecidas. De las diversas técnicas empleadas para el análisis de irregularidades, se presentan a continuación las utilizadas por la central para realizar dichas inspecciones. Endoscopia Los endoscopios son instrumentos para la realización de Inspección Visual Remota (RVI) en áreas de acceso difícil. Los equipos de inspección Visual Remota se usan para ahorrar tiempo y dinero al usuario al evitar tiempos de desmontajes para realizar inspecciones visuales o en aquellos casos en los que resulte imposible el acceso directo por parte del personal de mantenimiento para realizar la inspección visual. Se utilizan videoscopios para detectar discontinuidades en los tanques o tubos, los cuales están dotados de un tubo guía de fibra de vidrio en cuya cabeza existe una lente que permite observar, realizar fotos y videos de las partes seleccionadas. También poseen luz propia para, en caso de oscuridad, poder realizar la inspección. Análisis de aceite Efectuando análisis periódicos de las características del aceite se puede determinar su estado, por lo que se podrá decidir el cambio según su estado y no según el calendario o ciclos de funcionamiento, siendo la viscosidad cinemática la propiedad física más importante del aceite. Independientemente de conocer el estado del lubricante, puede obtenerse información adicional como contenido de partículas metálicas en suspensión, presencia de contaminantes, presencia de agua, etc. La central posee un laboratorio donde se realizan diferentes análisis del aceite dependiendo de lo que se desee comprobar. Cada muestra analizada es enviada al Página 113 Central Térmica de Compostilla proveedor, que en este caso es Repsol, donde se encargan de realizar un examen más exhaustivo para detallar de una forma óptima el contenido del aceite. Existen más de 100 análisis de aceites pero los utilizados por la central y proveedor son: • Examen visual. • Partículas en suspensión y decantadas. • Ensayo de viscosidad. • Ensayo de crackling. • Ferrografía. • Índice alcalinidad (TBN). • Índice de acidez (TAN).

Análisis de Vibraciones En general, todo cuerpo posee masa y un cierto grado de elasticidad tal que si es deformado tiende a recobrar su forma original, teniendo así las condiciones dinámicas que se traducen en fenómenos vibratorios. Raramente se avería una maquina sin dar previos avisos y dicho deterioro se caracteriza casi siempre por un aumento del nivel de vibraciones que se puede medir y tomarse como indicador del estado de la maquina. Para un correcto análisis se utiliza el empleo de técnicas de análisis basadas en el estudio de señales en el dominio de la frecuencia o análisis espectral cuyo objetivo es descomponer una señal compleja en sus componentes a diversas frecuencias. Esta descomposición se establece matemáticamente a partir del Análisis de Fourier que permite descomponer una señal periódica como suma de una cantidad infinita de señales simples senoidales de diversas amplitudes y frecuencias mediante la herramienta matemática denominada Transformada de Fourier en su desarrollo denominado Transformada Rápida de Fourier (FFT). Para el análisis de vibraciones se utilizan transductores de velocidad y de aceleración: Página 114 Central Térmica de Compostilla Transductor de desplazamiento A pesar de que existen captadores de desplazamiento de contacto deslizante, su rango de respuesta en frecuencia es muy bajo, por lo que no se utilizan para medida de la vibración. Para medir el desplazamiento que experimenta el eje respecto a la posición de referencia se utilizan transductores de no contacto, se mantienen inmóviles en una posición de referencia siendo sensibles a las variaciones de posición del elemento estudiado. Se utilizan en la turbina, en ejes que se quiera comprobar la variación de posición. Transductor de velocidad Un transductor de velocidad se basa en una bobina vibrante que, al moverse en el campo que crea el imán, produce una tensión de salida relativamente grande que no requiere acondicionador de señal, y la tensión es directamente proporcional a la velocidad de la vibración. Se suelen utilizar en ventiladores. Transductor de aceleración Los transductores de aceleración, o acelerómetros, son los más utilizados en la medida de las vibraciones, básicamente constan de un cristal piezoeléctrico apoyado sobre una base metálica la cual se fija a la superficie, mediante un imán, cuya vibración se desea medir. Sobre este cristal se apoya solidariamente un sistema inercial formado por una masa sobre la que se ejerce generalmente una precarga.

Los acelerómetros están conectados a un aparato llamado 2130 que es el encargado de recibir la información, almacenarla y realizar la transformada de Fourier. La norma que sigue la central está en velocidad (mm/s), norma que nos aporta los parámetros correctos de vibraciones. Se puede pasar de desplazamiento a velocidad y aceleración derivando la función obtenida y a la inversa integrando. Por último poner en conocimiento que la mayoría de análisis se realizan sobre cojinetes o rodamientos de los elementos que se desean estudiar, realizando pruebas en las direcciones vertical, horizontal y axial, antes y después del motor o elemento de estudio así como mediciones de temperatura también antes y después, para un mejor análisis. Termografía La termografía infrarroja es una técnica de ensayo no destructivo sin contacto, que a partir de la radiación infrarroja emitida por un objeto hace visible la distribución superficial de temperatura como imágenes térmicas o termogramas. Esta característica permite detectar anomalías por variaciones de temperatura y evaluarlas en tiempo real en equipos en funcionamiento. La radiación infrarroja es la parte del espectro electromagnético con una longitud de onda entre 0,75 µm a 30 µm, estableciéndose cuatro grupos según su longitud de onda: • 0,75 – 3 µm Infrarrojo cercano • 3 – 6 µm Infrarrojo intermedio Figura 68. Foto termográfica de un transformador Página 116 Central Térmica de Compostilla • 6 – 15 µm Infrarrojo lejano • 15 – 30 µm Infrarrojo extremo Para su visualización se utilizan cámaras termográficas como la de la figura y para una correcta lectura de la temperatura, debe conocerse la emisividad del material del objeto de estudio. Figura 69. Cámara termográfica Líquidos penetrantes La inspección por líquidos penetrantes se define como un procedimiento de inspección No Destructivo, de tipo fisicoquímico, diseñado para detectar e indicar discontinuidades presentes en la superficie de los materiales tales como fisuras, poros, dobleces de los materiales. En términos generales, esta prueba consiste en aplicar un líquido coloreado o fluorescente a la superficie a examinar, el cual penetra en las discontinuidades del material debido al fenómeno de capilaridad. Después de cierto tiempo, se elimina el exceso de penetrante y se aplica un revelador que absorbe el líquido que ha penetrado en las discontinuidades y sobre la capa de revelador se delinea el contorno de esta. Los líquidos penetrantes tienen la propiedad de filtrarse a través de las discontinuidades"

Los líquidos penetrantes tienen la propiedad de filtrarse a través de las discontinuidades que presentan los materiales, basándose en la acción capilar, la que origina que un líquido ascienda o descienda a través de dos paredes cercanas entre sí. También se basa en los principios físicos de cohesión, viscosidad, adherencia y tensión superficial. Página 117 Central Térmica de Compostilla Partículas magnéticas Es un método de ensayo no destructivo empleado en la detección de discontinuidades superficiales y sub superficiales, hasta 6,35mm de profundidad, en materiales ferromagnéticos, seleccionándose usualmente cuando se requiere una inspección más rápida que con los líquidos penetrantes. El principio físico es la formación de distorsiones del campo magnético o de polos cuando se genera o se induce un campo magnético en un material ferromagnético, es decir, cuando la pieza presenta una zona en la que existen discontinuidades perpendiculares a las líneas del campo magnético, este se deforma o produce campos de fuga o polos, las distorsiones o polos atraen a las partículas magnéticas, que fueron aplicadas en forma de polvo o suspensión en la superficie sujeta a inspección y que por acumulación producen las indicaciones que se observan visualmente de manera directa o bajo luz ultravioleta. Figura 70. Partículas magnéticas Página 118 Central Térmica de Compostilla Radiografía Industrial La inspección por radiografía industrial se define corno un procedimiento de inspección no destructivo de tipo físico, diseñado para detectar discontinuidades y variaciones en la estructura interna o configuración física de un material. Obtiene una imagen de la estructura interna de la pieza o componente, debido a que este método emplea radiación de alta energía que es capaz de penetrar materiales sólidos, por lo que el propósito principal de este tipo de inspección es la obtención de registros permanentes para el estudio y evaluación de discontinuidades presentes en dicho material. El principio físico en el que se basa esta técnica es la interacción entre la materia y la radiación electromagnética, siendo esta última de una longitud de onda muy corta y de alta energía. La corta longitud de onda de la radiación que emplea la radiografía le permite penetrar materiales sólidos, que absorben o reflejan la luz visible; lo que da lugar al uso de esta técnica en el control de productos soldados, fundiciones, forjas, etc.; para la detección de defectos internos tales como grietas, socavados, penetración incompleta en la raíz, falta de fusión, etc. Página 119 Central Térmica de Compostilla Fallos en turbinas de vapor Fallo de las válvulas de control Las"

La energía que se produce en la expansión es muy grande en comparación con el tamaño de la válvula. Dicho salto entálpico puede producir holguras o fisuras en la válvula además de formar óxidos Figura 71. Válvulas de estrangulación gracias a las elevadas temperaturas que posee el vapor. Los problemas comentados anteriormente pueden producir un mal funcionamiento de la misma lo que puede acarrear serios problemas pudiendo alcanzar, la turbina, velocidades superiores a las nominales y una consecuente ensalada de paletas. Fallo en los álabes por resonancia En cada cuerpo de una turbina, ya sea de baja presión, alta presión o presión intermedia, los álabes aumentan su tamaño a medida que realizan escalonamientos debido a la expansión del vapor y su consecuente aumento de volumen. Por este motivo es esencial realizar cálculos de vibraciones, mediante espectros, para evaluar las frecuencias a las que está sometida cada rueda de álabes. A medida que los álabes poseen mayor longitud, tienen una Figura 72. Álabes frecuencia natural inferior y consecuentemente una frecuencia de resonancia inferior. En caso que la frecuencia de un álabe coincida Página 120 Central Térmica de Compostilla con la frecuencia de resonancia se producirían vibraciones en el mismo que podría conllevar a la rotura del álabe. Vibraciones Al tratarse de turbomáquinas que giran a gran velocidad, se debe tener muy en cuenta las vibraciones que se puedan ocasionar. Para evitarlo se realiza un equilibrado del rotor mediante unos pesos ubicados en unos Figura 73. Orificios equilibrado rotor orificios practicados en el eje (Fig. 73). Para mayor seguridad se realizan ensayos no destructivos para el control de vibraciones mediante acelerómetros. Entrada de agua Es la causa de fallo más frecuente en turbinas de vapor. En el momento que entra agua al cuerpo de la turbina, que está a una temperatura elevada, produce cambios térmicos en los elementos, como álabes, además de producir golpes contra los mismos pudiendo provocar desde un incremento del rendimiento hasta erosión en las partes mecánicas de la turbina. Se puede ver provocada, la entrada de agua a la turbina, gracias a retornos de líneas de purga o aperturas erróneas de diferentes válvulas.

Erosión Los fallos por erosión se ven incrementados a medida que el vapor circula por los distintos escalonamientos, por eso las últimas ruedas de álabes son las que más expuestas son a verse afectadas por el fenómeno de erosión. Más concretamente en una turbina de condensación, que en sus últimas etapas trabaja con presiones subatmosféricas, es más Figura 74. Erosión en álabe Página 121 Central Térmica de Compostilla fácil que se pueda condensar parte del vapor en las últimas coronas de álabes del cuerpo de baja presión. El problema radica en la formación de gotas de agua que impactan en los álabes, a diferencia del vapor que “resbala” sobre ellos. Los factores que influyen en la erosión son; el tamaño de las gotas producidas, la diferencia del título del vapor entre coronas, velocidad de rotación y el posicionamiento de las toberas con respecto a los álabes y los cilindros. Fatiga La fatiga se presenta en materiales metálicos a temperaturas superiores a 400 °C. Cuando los elementos alcanzan dichas temperaturas pueden dilatarse, lo que provoca el aflojamiento de tornillos y otras fijaciones de los elementos estructurales que forman la turbina. Tensión térmica A diferencia de las turbinas de gas y los motores diesel, las turbinas de vapor carecen de buen comportamiento ante cambios rápidos de carga. Por ello en las etapas de puesta en marcha y apagado se debe tener en cuenta el fenómeno de tensión térmica. El vapor cuando entra en contacto con una superficie fría, como lo es la turbina en la etapa de puesta en marcha, puede transmitir el calor a través del metal a una velocidad superior que la capacidad de transferencia de calor que posee el metal, esto conlleva a una diferencia de temperaturas en los cuerpos de la turbina muy elevadas dependiendo de la altura de los mismos. Para contrarrestarlo se debe introducir el vapor en la cantidad exacta sin provocar cambios bruscos en la admisión del vapor. También recordar que en estas etapas se utiliza el virador que contribuye a evitar el fenómeno de la tensión térmica.

Página 134 Central Térmica de Compostilla Anexo 1 Revisión Caldera La revisión de la caldera tiene como punto de partida la limpieza de escoria depositada en los tubos del hogar. Para llevar a cabo este procedimiento se requiere de la participación de los llamados “alpinistas” cuyo trabajo consiste en descender desde el techo de la caldera (mediante unos orificios practicados en el techo), bien sujetos Figura 75. Caldera mediante cuerdas y arneses e ir picando la escoria depositada en los tubos. Decir que esta operación conlleva un gran riesgo ya que la escoria formada puede llegar a ser de grandes dimensiones. Una vez realizada dicha operación se procede a la colocación de un andamio en el interior del hogar para poder realizar las inspecciones necesarias. Detectores de llama La empresa, ha creído conveniente cambiar la ubicación de los detectores de llama que se ubicarán a una altura superior a la entrada de aire terciario, por encima de los quemadores. Cajas partidoras Las cajas partidoras tienen la función de dividir el flujo de entrada de carbón pulverizado más aire de admisión a los dos quemadores ciclónicos existentes para cada caja partidora. Debido al flujo de carbón, las rejillas que poseen las cajas partidoras se erosionan paulatinamente con lo que se desmontaran todas las cajas para su inspección y recambio si es necesario, Figura 76. Cajas partidoras Página 135 Central Térmica de Compostilla también se observará el estado de las bridas ya sean de las cajas, de los quemadores o de sus conductos. Quemadores ciclónicos Se realizan las tareas siguientes: - Apertura de las tapas de los ciclones, recuperando la tornillería para nuevo uso. - Reparación de las zonas erosionadas recargando o sustituyendo"

Ahora se procede a la extracción de las mitades inferiores de coronas, cierres y dummys procediendo de la misma manera que las mitades superiores. Figura 89. Rotor antiguo alta y media presión En dicha revisión se procede al cambio total del rotor de alta presión incluyendo coronas, dummys y cierres. La empresa ha realizado dicha mejora ya que la eficiencia del grupo, según cálculos anteriores, se vería incrementada en un 2%, lo cual significa un mayor rendimiento. Decir que se tiene previsión de cambiar al rotor de alta de los demás grupos, en función de los resultados obtenidos en futuras pruebas de rendimiento. La próxima tarea a realizar es la comprobación de los huelgos axiales de las coronas y dummys nuevos. Para ello se deben insertar las mitades inferiores de las nuevas coronas, dummys y cierres. Una vez colocados se procede a la colocación del nuevo rotor midiendo los huelgos axiales de Figura 90.

Nuevo rotor de alta y media presión Página 147 Central Térmica de Compostilla derecha a izquierda. Una vez medidos se procede a la extracción del nuevo rotor y los nuevos dummys, coronas y cierres. A partir de aquí se procede al envío a Ferrol a la empresa Navantia, que se encarga del mecanizado del rotor y de ajustar los huelgos de dummys, cierres y coronas a los huelgos de diseño. Ahora es el momento de la extracción de la parte interior inferior del cilindro de alta presión así como la parte inferior de los cojinetes, de la misma manera que se ha comentado anteriormente. Decir que para medir los huelgos de los cojinetes se hará uso del micrómetro. Para la turbina de baja presión se realizarán los mismos procedimientos que para la turbina de alta presión, con algunas variaciones. Se detallan a continuación las tareas a realizar en el momento de montar de nuevo la turbina de baja presión: - En primer lugar se colocan la parte inferior de los cojinetes, en este caso los números 3 y 4. Figura 91. Turbina baja presión - A continuación se procede a montar la mitad inferior del cilindro número 2 de baja presión. - Seguidamente se colocan partes inferiores de dummys, cierres y coronas y se ubican varillas de plomo para realizar mediciones una vez colocado el rotor de baja presión. - Para saber que el rotor se apoya sobre los cojinetes se pintan de azul la zona de contacto entre rotor y cojinete y se verifica visualmente si el cojinete se ha coloreado de azul, cosa que significa que existe contacto. - Una vez medidos todos los huelgos axiales y radiales, del rotor y de los demás elementos se procede a la colocación definitiva del rotor de baja presión.

This requires changing the portfolio of energy basket from fossils to non- renewables, reduce energy use through energy efficiency and conservation and reduce GHG emissions. The broad intent and its goals can only be achieved by coordinated actions at ground level by society, business, industry and government. As part of its endeavour the Government of India is formulating policies, action plans to support and guide industry and entrusted National Productivity Council to prepare of Best Practices Manual for Reducing GHG Emissions in various sectors namely, Thermal Power Plant, Chlor Alkali, Cement, Pulp and Paper and Iron and Steel. This manual is expected to serve as reference manual for • Identifying sources of GHG emissions • Assess and quantify emissions. • Evaluate and assess potential to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. • Propose a menu of options which industry can consider for assessment and implementation. The scope of this manual covers GHG emissions in the plant boundary and does not include transportation of raw materials, products and wastes to secured landfills, emissions from domestic waste treatment and emissions from sales and other offices. It is hoped the manual will be useful as a handy reference for all levels of engineers and managers working in the sector. 2 STUDY TEAM Project Coordinator Mr. R Virendra, Dy.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND Energy is a major driver of economy and the per capita consumption of energy is a lead indicator of its development. The fossil fuels, comprising about 72% of the energy basket as of 20131, is the major contributor of GHG emissions and consequently global warming. The wider consensus that the temperature rise is to be limited to 2oC requires reducing these emissions by changing the portfolio of energy mix from fossil fuels to non- renewable sources, and reducing energy use through energy efficiency and conservation. India is a net energy importing country and its GDP growth is expected to be highest among the world. To maintain its growth rate as well as to ensure energy security and meet its"

India is a net energy importing country and its GDP growth is expected to be highest among the world. To maintain its growth rate as well as to ensure energy security and meet its committed GHG emission target reduction (30-35%) by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-renewable power generation capacity to 40% of total generation, create carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO e), India needs to shift its energy consumption towards 2 renewable energy, besides adopting energy conservation and management measures. Studies indicate potential to reduce GHG emissions as shown in Figure 1.1. 1http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS 4 Figure 1.1 Indian GHG Emission Scenario (Past, Current & Projected) Source: Pathways to lowcarbon_economy_Version2 As can be seen, industrial sector’s GHG reduction potential is about 680 million tonnes CO e per year. In line with these projections provided by various studies, Government of 2 India evolved policies, action plans and mission oriented programs to address the following objectives and issues. • Energy security – to meet present and future needs • Environmental impact-to address local emissions & global climate change • Economic development – to create a sustainable development • Ease of implementation 1.2 ABOUT THE PROJECT To ensure effective translation of policy and implementation of action plans, Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), under Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India has entrusted National Productivity Council of India (NPC) with the project entitled “Preparation of Good Practices Manuals for Green House Gas Emission Reduction in Five Energy Intensive Industry Sectors in India” under the 12th Plan period (2012-2017). The scope of the project is to conduct field and questionnaire survey in five selected energy intensive sectors (Thermal Power Plant, Chlor Alkali, Cement, Pulp and Paper and Iron and Steel) of Indian economy, and bringing out manuals on Good Practices for GHG Emission reduction in the selected energy intensive sectors. Out of these five energy intensive sectors, this manual highlights the best practices involved for reducing Green House Gases Emission Reduction in Thermal Power Plant sector. This manual brings out sources and trends driving India’s greenhouse gas emissions in the Thermal Power Plant sector, outlining present situation and technologies that offer potential for significant emission reductions through enhanced energy efficiency that will put India on a sustained low-carbon path without sacrificing economic growth. It also highlights the Government of India policies and interventions that spur energy efficiency and GHG reduction activities in the sector eventually leading to improving energy security. 1.3 METHODOLOGY For preparing this manual, following methodology was adopted: 5 • Sector reports were prepared with inputs from questionnaire survey, detailed field visits and audits, workshops and"

The present temperature is 0.3−0.6 °C warmer than it was 100 years ago. The key greenhouse gas (GHG) causing global warming through human enhanced GHG effect is carbon dioxide. The natural greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from the earth's atmosphere warms its surface to a temperature above what it would be without its greenhouse gases naturally present in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases naturally present in the atmosphere include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Certain human activities add to the levels of most of the naturally occurring gases. For example, carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere when fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, coal, wood etc are burned. The enhanced greenhouse gas effect is the further rise in average earth’s temperature due to increase in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere due to human activities. Both these effects are depicted in Figure 1.2. 6 Figure 1.2 Natural and Human Enhanced Greenhouse Effect Green House Gases (GHG) is of two types namely direct and indirect. Direct GHG contribute directly to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere by trapping the infrared radiation near the earth’s surface. The major GHG gases identified by Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrogen fluorocarbons, per fluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride. Indirect GHG control the oxidising capacity of the troposphere by reducing the hydroxyl radicals distribution thereby increasing the residence time of some direct greenhouse gases, such as methane and ozone. Although there are a number of ways of measuring the strength of different greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the most useful indicator. The GWP for different GHG is shown in Table 1.1. GWP depends upon the greenhouse gas ability to absorb heat in the atmosphere. HFCs and"

The GWP for different GHG is shown in Table 1.1. GWP depends upon the greenhouse gas ability to absorb heat in the atmosphere. HFCs and PFCs are the most heat-absorbent. Methane traps over 21 times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide absorbs 270 times more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide.

India, owing to higher population, per capita CO 2 emission is the least. However, in terms of absolute emissions India is the third largest CO emitting country, behind the US and China (2015) and contributing about 6 % (2.3 Gt 2 CO ) of global emissions (WEO 2015). 2 Figure 1.3 Per capita CO Emissions 2 Impacts of Global Warming Rise in Global Temperature Observations show that global temperatures have risen by about 0.6 °C over the 20th century. There is strong evidence now that most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is caused by human activities. Various climate models predict that the global temperature will rise by about 6 °C by the year 2100. Rise in Sea Level In general, the faster the climatic change, the greater will be the risk of damage. The mean sea level is expected to rise 9 - 88 cm by the year 2100, causing flooding of low lying areas and other damages. Food Shortages and Hunger Water resources will be affected as precipitation and evaporation patterns change around the world. This will affect agricultural output.

Food security is likely to be threatened and some regions are likely to experience food shortages and hunger. 8 Models predict an average increase in temperature in India of 2.3 to 4.8oC for the benchmark doubling of carbon dioxide scenario. It is estimated that 7 million people would be displaced, 5700 km2 of land and 4200 km of road would be lost, and wheat yields could decrease significantly. Due to rising energy demand, India’s CO emissions is expected to grow at the rate of 7% 2 and surpass the present EU-28 emissions by 2020. As a part of mitigation effort, India is committed to increase its share of non-fossil energy sources from current 19% to 40% by 2030. Combustion of fossil fuel will continue to be the single major contributor to the global warming and hence the focus world-wide is on efforts to opt for renewable energy and enhance energy efficiency. 1.5 OUTLINE OF ENERGY SCENARIO IN INDIA The energy mix of India for 2013 presented in the pie chart (Figure 1.4) indicates fossil fuel is the main stay of India’s energy mix. Figure 2.4 Primary Energy Demand in India for 775 MTOE (Source : IEA, 2015) Industrial energy demand has almost doubled over the 2000-2013 period, with strong growth from coal and electricity. Large expansion in the energy-intensive sectors is anticipated in the future. The present energy consumption in these energy intensive sectors in the country is high compared to the developed world. The major energy consuming sectors in the country are Iron & Steel, Chemicals, Textiles, Aluminium, Fertilizers, Cement & Paper. These sectors account for about 60% of the total energy consumption in industry. The energy consumption in manufacturing is relatively high in India which is 9 reflected in the Specific Energy Consumption (SEC). This, therefore, provides an opportunity to reduce energy consumption and thereby GHG emissions. The typical SECs in different manufacturing sectors is presented in Table 1.2.

THERMAL POWER PLANT PROFILE 2.1 INTRODUCTION The thermal power plants can be classified on the basis of the fuel used for power generation. On the basis of fuel used, thermal power plants may be classified as • Coal based thermal power plants • Gas based thermal power plants • Oil based thermal power plants Coal Based Thermal Power Plants A coal fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler. The steam drives a steam turbine, this steam turbine is coupled with a generator which in turn produces electricity. The waste products of combustion include ash, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Gas Based Thermal Power Plants In this case, natural gas is fired in a gas turbine which acts as the prime mover. The gas turbine is coupled with a generator to produce electricity. The exhaust gases from gas turbine are at very high temperature which can further be utilised for process heating or electricity production through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a steam turbine. It may however be noted that gas being a cleaner fuel produces less GHG emissions compared to Coal Based Power Plants. Further with less availability of natural gas and higher cost of generation being a cause of concern, the gas based power plants operate intermittently"

Further with less availability of natural gas and higher cost of generation being a cause of concern, the gas based power plants operate intermittently and at low capacities, depending on the requirements. Under such circumstances, it would be inappropriate to consider any productivity or performance improvement options. Hence, the gas based power plants are not covered in this report. Oil Based Power plants In case of oil-based power plants, oil is combusted in a steam generator to generate steam and this steam is used to drive a steam turbine to produce electricity. In some other type of oil based power plants, oil is used as fuel to run turbines or engines which act as prime movers and coupled with generators, produce electricity. 14 Oil based power plants are very few in numbers and at remote locations, which are operated only in emergency. Hence, the oil based power plants are also not included in this report. 2.2 PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The assessment of productivity and performance of a thermal power plant could be carried out by monitoring various parameters. The major parameters that highlight the actual performance of thermal power plants are listed below.  Heat Rate (Indicator of Fuel Consumption per unit of Power Generation)  Plant Load Factor (PLF)  Auxiliary Power Consumption (Internal Consumption)  Generation Efficiency  GHG Emissions Heat Rate Heat rate is the measure of performance of a power plant which signifies the amount of thermal energy consumed for production of one unit of electricity. Heat rate is expressed in kCals per KWh. Lower the heat rate of a thermal power plant, better is the performance. Plant Load Factor (PLF) Plant Load Factor (PLF) is the ratio between the actual energy generated by the plant to the maximum possible energy that can be generated with the plant working at its rated power for a particular duration of time. Higher plant load factor (PLF) signifies better utilisation of capacity and hence, better performance of a thermal power plant. Auxiliary Power Consumption (Internal Consumption) APC is the amount of energy consumed within the plant for normal operation of a power plant. For production of electricity, power plants operate various auxiliaries and consume electricity which is a part of the gross energy produced by the plant. The net energy exported by a plant is the energy available after accounting for APC. Lower the APC, signifies better the performance of a power plant. 15 Generation Efficiency Generation Efficiency of a thermal power plant signifies its performance in terms of energy supplied that"

Lower the APC, signifies better the performance of a power plant. 15 Generation Efficiency Generation Efficiency of a thermal power plant signifies its performance in terms of energy supplied that got converted into useful work (electricity). It is the ratio of the energy produced by the plant to energy supplied to the plant. The remaining energy is usually lost to the environment as heat. This is expressed in percentage and higher the efficiency of a power plant, better is the performance. GHG Emissions Every thermal power plant consumes fossil fuel for generation of electricity in form of coal or natural gas. As the combustion of these fuels take place it results in generation of CO , Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) which are GHG gases and 2 contribute to global warming. The amount of GHGs emitted for production of every unit of electricity differs from plant to plant and is dependent on its performance. High GHG emission for generation of a unit of electricity shows poor performance of a plant as compared to the plant that is generating same amount of electricity with lesser amount of GHG emissions, for a given fuel. Coal power plant Performance indicators and Benchmarks The coal based thermal power plants may be classified on the basis of their generation capacity and for this report purpose we are categorising the units in the following four capacity ranges. • Upto 150 MW • 150 MW to 240 MW • 250 MW to below 500 MW • 500 MW and above Table: 2.1 Heat Rate Category National Indian Benchmark International Average (Best Operating) Benchmark (kCals/KWh) (kCals/KWh) (2013- (kCals/KWh) 14) (2013-14) 150 MW and below 2755 2528 150 MW to 240 MW 2592 2314 250 MW to below 500 MW 2430 2216 16 500 MW and Above 2358 2358 Table 2.1: Plant Load Factor (PLF) Category National Average Indian Benchmark International (%) (Best Operating) Benchmark (%) (2013-14) (%) (2013-14) 150 MW and below 54.66 92.8 150 MW to 240 MW 70.37 89.48 250 MW to below 500 61.62 93.9 MW 500 MW and above 56.12 83.8 Table 2.3: Auxiliary Power Consumption (Internal Consumption) Category National Average Indian Benchmark International (%) (2013-14) (Best Operating) Benchmark (%) (2013-14) (%) (2013-14) 150 MW and below 12.10 6.91 150 MW to 240 MW 8.30 7.02 250 MW to below 500 8.78 6.41 MW 500 MW and above 6.79 5.48 Table 2.4: Efficiency Category National Average Indian Benchmark International (%) (Best Operating) Benchmark (%) (2013-14) (%) (2013-14) 150 MW and below 31.22 34.02 150 MW to 240 MW 33.17 37.16 250 MW"

THERMAL POWER PLANT PRACTICES / TECHNOLOGIES 3.1 COAL-BASED THERMAL POWER PLANT The Figure 3.1 shows the schematic diagram of thermal power plant. In coal thermal power plant, the steam is produced in high pressure in the steam boiler due to burning of fuel (pulverized coal) in boiler furnaces. This steam is further superheated in a super heater. This supper heated steam then enters into the turbine and rotates the turbine blades. The turbine is mechanically so coupled with alternator that its rotor will rotate with the rotation of turbine blades to produce electricity. Figure 3.1 Schematic Diagram of Thermal Power Plant The basic components of the thermal power station are: • Coal Handling Plant • Boiler • Steam turbine • Generator/Alternator • Condenser • Boiler feed pump 19 • Forced or induced draft fan system • Ash Handling Plant Coal Handling Plant A pulverizer or grinder is a mechanical device for the grinding of many different types of materials. The coal pulverizer (Figure 3.2) is used to pulverize coal for combustion in the steam-generating furnaces of coal based power plant. Figure 3.2 Coal Pulverizer Boiler A boiler or steam generator essentially is a container into which water can be fed and steam can be taken out at desired pressure, temperature and flow (refer Figure 3.3). This calls for application of heat on the container. For that the boiler should have a facility to burn a fuel and release the heat. The functions of a boiler thus can be stated as: 1. To convert chemical energy of the fuel into heat energy 2. To transfer this heat energy to water for evaporation as well to steam for superheating 20 Figure 3.2 Boiler Steam Turbine A steam turbine is a device which extracts thermal energy from the pressurized steam (refer Figure 3.3).

Boiler Feed Pump A boiler feed pump is a specific type of pump which is used to feed the water into the steam boiler (Figure 3.5). 22 Figure 3.5 Boiler Feed Pump Forced and Induced Draft Fan System Fans system provides the boiler with air that is required for combustion of coal. The Forced Draft fan sends the air into the ‘heating system’ of the power plant which comprises of air preheater, furnace, superheater, economiser etc. and Induced Draft fan works at almost second last stage of the system, sucking out flue gases and finally sending them to chimney. Ash Handling System The disposal of ash from a power station is important as ash is produced in large quantities. For ash handling, two type of systems are generally employed that are dry ash handling and wet ash handling depending upon suitability. • Dry Ash Handling: Ash is collected by electro static precipitator (ESP) and bag filters and collected in ash collection silo. This ash is used in manufacturing of cement and bricks. • Wet Ash Handling system: The collected ash is mixed with water and is pumped to ash pond where it gets settled. 23 4.

Corresponding GHG emission reduction for production of 1 million units of electricity would be 7.57 tonnes of CO . 2 Reduction in Excess Air Ratio For combustion of any fuel, oxygen is required which is supplied by air. Every fuel has its theoretical air requirement for complete combustion. In practice however, the theoretical air alone is not sufficient to ensure proper and complete combustion and invariably there is a need to supply some excess air. The optimum excess air level for maximum boiler efficiency occurs when the sum of the losses due to incomplete combustion and loss due to heat in flue gas is minimised. This level varies with furnace design, type of burner, fuel and operational variables which can be determined by conducting tests with different air fuel ratio at different loads. Excess air can be optimised by effective control of air-fuel ratio. For general operation of thermal power plant boiler the accepted excess air percentage is around 20%, but it can still be further reduced to 14-15% for reducing dry flue gas losses. Controlling excess air to an optimum level always results in reduction in flue gas loses. For every one percent reduction in excess air, there is approximately 0.6% rise in boiler efficiency. The corresponding reduction in GHG emission will be 4.5 tCO /Million Units. 2 Reduction in the Stack Gas Exit Temperature 26 The products of combustion after transferring heat to water for steam generation are let into atmosphere through stack. The temperature of this flue gas is normally in range of 160-200oC. Higher the stack temperature, greater would be the heat loss from the boiler. By effective heat recovery and draft control can reduce fuel consumption in the boiler. However, the flue gas temperature should not be reduced so much that it results in condensation on the stack walls. Every 22oC reduction in stack temperature would result in 1% improvement in boiler efficiency. The corresponding reduction in GHG emission would be 7.57 tCO /Million 2 units. Soot Blower Optimisation The soot produced during burning fuel (coal) in the boiler, sticks to the superheater tubes impeding heat transfer. As the soot deposition increases, the heat transfer effectiveness decreases. This soot is therefore removed periodically through soot blowers. The operation of the soot blowers is normally predetermined and is operated once every shift. A proactive approach to soot blowing where in, soot blowing is done as per requirement could reduce steam consumption (in soot blowing) without affecting the boiler performance. The control use of soot blowing is expected to reduce steam consumption by"

A proactive approach to soot blowing where in, soot blowing is done as per requirement could reduce steam consumption (in soot blowing) without affecting the boiler performance. The control use of soot blowing is expected to reduce steam consumption by about 2 Tonnes per day. This can also be achieved by installing smart wall blowing systems for automatic control and avoiding manual interventions. Steam Leaks Reduction Steam leakages are common scenario in thermal power plants. While it may not be possible to completely eliminate the leakage of steam but it can be largely arrested. Steam leaks have multiple negative effects on steam-based plant operations, including energy losses, increased emissions, loss of reliability, production issues, and safety issues. Estimating the leakage is difficult to do because the orifice is not perfectly round. Measuring the diameter only can be done by visual inspection because physical measurements will cause burns. The plume length is highly dependent on the pressure of the leak, and volume is dependent on the diameter and pressure. It is estimate that in existing power plants, checking and reducing the steam leakages can improve the efficiency by upto 1% The corresponding GHG emission reduction would be 7.5 TCO /MU. 2 27 Improvement in Hot Re-Heat Temperature The steam from HP turbine is reheated before being sent to Intermediate Pressure Turbine. Maintaining the desired reheat temperature helps in improving the performance of a power plant. Possible reasons for reduce reheat temperature may be • fouling in reheat tubes • reheat attemperation control valve leakage • incorrect amount of reheater heat transfer area etc. Every 10oC increase in reheat temperature is expected to improve the heat rate by 5 Kcals/kWh. The impact on GHG emission reduction would be 3 TCO /MU. 2 Modification in Auto Furnace Draft Control Logic Of Id Fan Vane- Scoop Combination Control Background The furnace draft control is kept in ‘auto’ with a set point of –5.0 to –8.0mmwc. The ‘vane-scoop combination controls’ of the running ID Fan/Fans are also placed in ‘auto’. Furnace draft controller measures Furnace draft & compares with set point. Output signal is generated & fed to ID Fan ‘Vane scoop control’. Intel guide vane control is quicker compared to speed control using the variable fluid coupling. However, throttling the inlet guide vane leads to reduction in operating efficiency of the fan. Flow control by controlling the speed (like fluid coupling scoop control) is more energy efficient than inlet vane control though the later is quicker in response. The purpose of the modification of ID Fan operation control logic was to ensure efficient and stable furnace draft control with combination response of vane &"

The purpose of the modification of ID Fan operation control logic was to ensure efficient and stable furnace draft control with combination response of vane & scoop. Previous status As per the original design philosophy, the vanes would modulate first from 35% (lower limit) to 55% (upper limit) as per demand signal. Once it reached limits, the vane remained fixed & demand signal went to operate Scoop. Scoop would take a position and desired furnace draft was achieved. Area of concern: the main drawback of the previous control logic was that during high load (full load) the vane opening was limited to 55% whereas the scoop was nearly at 28 100% position. It was an energy inefficient control resulting in very high ID Fan power Consumption. Project implemented Vane control upper and lower limits were made dynamic and compatible with scoop control position feedback. Initially due to the priority set in the process logic, the demand signal modulates the vane. Once it reaches upper / lower limit, scoop starts changing position. When scoop reaches a certain position, the vane upper set point becomes dynamic & increases to higher value (governed by a calculation dependent on scoop position feedback). Next on receiving further demand signal, scoop remains constant and vane modulates till it reaches changed upper limit. Subsequently the demand signal increases the scoop further. Again, the vane upper limit becomes dynamic and after incremental rise it freezes at a higher value. Benefits After modification of the control logic, each ID Fan energy consumption reduced by 7-9 % depending on the coal quality. Resulting in GHG emission reduction of around 0.45 TCO /MU. 2 Reducing Slag Formation in Boiler Normally, the original design of units in India is for Indian coal having ash fusion temperature of 1400 OC. However as a common practice, to maintain the GCV of coal, a small amount of Indonesian coal having ash fusion temperature in the range of 1170 to 1230 OC is mixed in calculated proportions. Slagging index for such coal being higher, it is prone for slagging causing lower heat absorption mainly in Super heater panels. Trials of injecting special slag reduction chemicals (a mixture of Magnesium oxides and phosphate salts) on fire side may be carried out to minimize impact of slagging. Dosing quantity & frequency may be optimized. Gain in terms of increased heat absorption & decrease in flue gas exit temperature may be limited to maximum 4OC. resulting into efficiency improvement of around 0.18% and corresponding reduction in GHG Emission of around 1.3 TCO /MU of generation."

The performance of feed water heaters may be inspected during the outage. The heaters may be checked for holes due to erosion in the diaphragms 29 that separated the feed water inlet and outlet water boxes, causing partial bypassing of water in the heater in HP heater, leading to lower feed water temperature. Corrective action may be taken and the heater performance restored back to design conditions. The online availability of the relevant data as well as the facility of historising the data can make the analysis of the problem easier. Ensuring proper feedwater heating by minimising leakages in feedwater heater is expected to reduce the plant heat rate by 6 kCals/kWh. The corresponding GHG emission reduction would be around 3.5 TCO /MU. 2 Application of LT VFD for HT Motors Some relatively small power plants auxiliary equipment such as CEP, Drip water pump etc are operated with HT Motors. It is observed that the actual output requirement in most cases under normal operating condition is lower than the designed. This necessitates regulating the capacity which is normally accomplished through throttle valve. Being HT dries, Installing HT VFD becomes a costly preposition. It is possible to regulate the capacities of such equipments using LT VFD drives with provision of stepping down and stepping up the voltages across the VFD. Energy saving of the tune of 20-40% can be achieved by such an arrangement, at a considerably lower cost of installation of HT VFD. Assuming a minimum 20% saving due to such an arrangement on CEP, the GHG Emission reduction potential is around 0.2 TCO /MU. 2 Blinding One Stage of High Pressure Boiler Feed Pump (HPBFP) In thermal power plants it is necessary that the BFPs are designed for pressure higher than the drum pressure to pump water into the boiler drums. There will be no flow from BFP if drum pressure exceeds the pressure generated by BFP. In many cases it is observed that pressure generated by BFP is much higher than the boiler drum pressure. In such cases the BFPs pump water at much higher pressure than the required pressure thus consume extra energy which can be avoided by pressure reduction. One good option for BFP pressure reduction is to blind"

In such cases the BFPs pump water at much higher pressure than the required pressure thus consume extra energy which can be avoided by pressure reduction. One good option for BFP pressure reduction is to blind one or more stages of BFP so that the pressure thus generated is just higher than the drum pressure, flow remaining the same. Depending on the difference in actual pressure generated and the oprerating pressure, the number of stages to be removed/blinded would vary. Every stage removal in BFP is 30 ecpectes to reduce energy consumption be about 8% (Assuming total 12 stages). The impact on GHG emission reduction would be 1.5 TCO /MU. 2 Optimising Air Preheaters In air-preheater as the pressure of fresh air being heated is higher than the pressure of hot flue gas duct, there is a possibility of air leaking into the flue gas path, due to improper sealing in the air heater or puncture in the tubes. This air leakage which is lost to the atmosphere not only effects heat recovery but also increases load on ID and FD Fans. He input is therefore two fold, i.e. increase in losses in the boiler and increasing power consumption in auxiliaries (ID and FD Fans). Every 5% increase in air leakage would result in additional GHG emission of 0.57 TCO /MU. 2 Optimisation of Combustion system Unburnts in fly ash contributes to heat loss in boilers. Regulating the combustion air supplied, depending upon the coal quality could reduce this loss. Every one percent reduction of unburnts in bottom ash would lead to 0.1 TCO GHG emission reduction for 2 every one million units of power generation. It should however be ensured that the losses in flue gas does not get compromised as a result of this measure. Adoption of coal quality management system can also help in reduction of such losses. Cooling System Performance Improvement Cooling tower performance has an impact on the cooling water going to the condenser. This in turn affects the vacuum maintained in condenser. The cooling the cooling tower performance is affected due to the following factors. • Insufficient/excess cooling water flow. • Nozzle choking in the cooling tower basin resulting in uneven distribution of water. • Algae formation in Cooling tower. Any impact on cooling tower performance results in higher cooling water temperature going to the condenser. Every 3OC increase in the cooling water temperature would impact 31 the condenser vacuum by 1 KPa (0.01Kg/CM ). This in turn will lead to GHG emission of 2 7.5 TCO2/MU.

This in turn will lead to GHG emission of 2 7.5 TCO2/MU. Steam Turbine Refurbishment With passage of time, performance of the steam turbine drops, leading to higher steam consumption for maintaining the same power output. A turbine which is operated for 15 years, even after regular overhauls, would still end up operating at a slightly lower efficiency. Every 1% drop in turbine efficiency would result in additional coal consumption of 1.2% causing additional GHG emission of 9 TCO /MU. 2 Thus, it is advisable to go for steam turbine refurbishment if a considerable drop in turbine efficiency is observed. Other General Recommendations Boiler Maintenance for Minimising Boiler Tube Failure Boiler tube leakage one of the major reasons for forced outage. Over stressing, Starvation, Overheating of tubes, Creep life exhaustion, Stress corrosion, Waterside Corrosion, Fireside Erosion, Hydrogen embrittlement, Age embrittlement, Thermal shocks, Improper operating practices, Poor maintenance, Welding defects etc are the major causes for boiler tube failure. The following are the general measures adopted in thermal power station to minimize the boiler tube failures: • Thorough visual inspection of heating surfaces to identify eroded tube , deformation, swelling, bulging of tubes, etc. • Shielding of tubes / bends in some identified, highly erosion prone areas to reduce erosion due to gas velocity in second pass. • Tube thickness survey and thickness mapping in all identified areas. The general practice is to replace the eroded tubes with thickness reduced more than 25% of normal thickness. • 100% welding inspection to ensure quality weld joints. Involvement of experience IBR welders for pressure parts welding works. • Emphasis to prevent flue gas / ash erosion. Erosion prone areas are extensively inspected and protected by providing shield / baffles, refractory etc. Chillers performance improvement Fire hydrant system improvement Online performance monitoring system development and implementation 32 Super Cleaning Of Turbine Oil/Coal mill gear box oil with Electrostatic Liquid cleaner (ELC) High Concentration Slurry System for Ash Handling Substituting glass wool insulation for chilled water lines by PUF insulation Long term Recommendations for Productivity and Performance improvement Increase in air heater surface Gas turbine output improvement High concentration slurry system for ash handling Coal mill gear-box lube oil electrostatic liquid cleaning Introduction of super cleaning of turbine oil Installation/improvement of process controls Installation of coal drying system Improvement of atmospheric condensate collections from all gas turbine inlet.

INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) As the world’s expendable energy resources deplete and the industrial sector is being asked to deliver more to a growing population, energy efficiency has taken center stage to ensure the longevity of these energy resources, and the Internet of Things can play a crucial role. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) almost certainly is the most important single development in the long evolution of energy management. The insight derived from data collected from new Internet-connected devices can be used to develop new services, enhance productivity and efficiency, improve real-time decision making, solve critical problems, and create new and innovative experiences.

Traditionally, many plants do not have the technology in place to track and measure energy use. On top of that, information on a plant’s energy production and consumption is not consolidated into a single place. Energy production and consumption data is often not visible in real time and is not presented at a level granular enough to reflect how changes in behaviour affect energy use. With limited information at their disposal, energy managers can have a difficult time finding the places where energy use could improve. To develop a clear energy-saving strategy and drive energy-saving behaviour, managers need to boost monitoring capabilities and this data needs to be coordinated into a single system. The Internet of Things (IoT) captures information seamlessly from the sensors and machines that monitor all aspects of the manufacturing process. The information it returns offer greater visibility into actionable data that can result in significant energy savings. Network sensors track energy performance, monitor for leaks and flag any subpar operating situations. Adding Internet of Things sensor technology to a plant allows for real-time alerts that notify energy managers about wasteful situations. Energy managers can then take timely action before their operation loses large amounts of money. Further, the Internet of Things gets the right information to the right expert– whether that person is an onsite manager, an off-site facility specialist, or a third party expert—when they need it, so they can make the best decisions to improve energy performance. 40 ACRONYMS & ABBREVIATIONS GHG – Green House Gases GDP – Gross Domestic Product IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GWP – Global Warming Potential Gt.CO2 – Giga Tonne Carbon dioxide MTOE – Metric Tonne Oil Equivalent RPS – Renewable Portfolio Standards TPD – Tonnes per Day AOX – Absorbable Organic Demand BOD –Biological Oxygen Demand COD – Chemical Oxygen Demand ADT – Air Dried Tonne GCV – Gross Calorific Value NCV – Net Calorific Value TOE – Tonne Oil Equivalent Mkcals- Million Kilo calories PLF – Plant Load Factor TPP – Thermal Power Plant KWh – Kilo Watt Hour CFM – Cubic Feet Per Minute CEP – Condensate Extraction Pump VFD – Variable Frequency Drive ESP – Electro Static Precipitator APC – Auxiliary Power Consumption HRSG – Heat Recovery Steam Generator 41 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

To all the unsung heroes who spend their sleepless nights silently running the power stations, keeping the nation growing Preface Conversion ofthermalenergy toelectricity isnot a high-efficiency process.As the conversion temperature approaches the characteristic temperature of the fuel (for coal this is approximately 3000 °C), the efficiency of conversion increases. However, metallurgic constraints restrict the conversion temperature to a much lowervalue(approximately600°C).Researchisongoingforachievingtemperatures near 700 °C. Furthermore, derating of thermal power generators due to various reasons poses problems to the power industry, as the available capacity becomes reduced. Thermal power generation is a highly capital-intensive industry, an envi- ronmentpolluterbydefault,andalargeconsumerofprimaryresourcessuchasland, water,andfuel.Therefore,theoperatingavailabilityoftheinstalledcapacity,design efficiency, and longer life spans are a serious concern. Undoubtedly, the ability to run beyond the regulatory period with high loading factors and high efficiencies gives thermalpowerplantsa cutting-edge advantage ofcommercial superiority. Various subsystems of a thermal power generator are built upon integrating many types of equipment. The subsystems operate in coordination to generate power with sustained reliability. Extensive research and development by the manufacturers of such equipment has improved the efficiency of individual pieces of equipment to a great extent. However, the overall operating efficiency of any subsystem depends on the optimum design of the subsystem and the operating practices.Therefore,operatingandmaintainingathermalpowergeneratorrequires understanding of system-level dynamics, which is different from the equipment-level operating and maintenance procedures.

Residual life assessment of plant components hover around two different approaches, one using data analysis based on operational history and the other based on a periodic examination of critical components.

Therefore, managing water chemistry for cycle water as well as cooling water is a major challenge to power station managers. In addition to water, the chemical analysis of lubricating oil, transformer oil, etc. predicts the condition of different equipment. Chemical Preface ix analysis of flue gas predicts the efficiency of combustion. Considering all these facts, this book makes a special emphasis on thermal power plant chemistry. Thetaskandtimingofmajorequipmentmaintenanceisdeterminedbypredictive maintenanceorreliability-centeredmaintenancefocusedontheengineeringsideof maintenance.Asfinancialconstraintsareplacedonmaintenanceresources,thereis an increasing need for determining the timing of maintenance taking into consid- eration the financial expenditure and impacts. Risk Evaluation and Prioritization (REAP) provides the plant management quantified assessments offinancial invest- ment decisions of maintenance. Different maintenance strategies are deployed to avoid breakdowns, premature equipment malfunctions, and to increase response times to recover from failure, in order to effect improvements in overall plant availability. This book also covers details on theplanning part of maintenance. A large number offorced outages occur per year due to human error which not only affects the industry in terms offinancial losses, but also in terms of its repu- tation among its customers as a reliable power producer. The root causes of these human errors have been discussed in detail for better outage management. Best practices are not just benchmarking parameters. Implementation of these practices creates long-term sustainability. Best practices have many dimensions startingfrommaximizingefficiencytomaximizinglifespan.Thechapterdedicated to best practices in this book has covered many dimensions of good practices to minimize resource utilization, better environment management, knowledge man- agement with maximizing growth, and life span.

Moreover, the instructions and directives do not speak about the knowledge and reasoning.

I am particularly grateful to Mr. D. S. Mallick, Executive Director, M/S Development Consultants Private Limited (DCPL), who prompted me to write this book. I am also inspired by Dr. S. Dattagupta, Retired Professor, Power Engineering, Jadavpur University, and Dr. Amitava Datta, Professor, Power Engineering, Jadavpur University. Mr. Samiran Chakraboty, retired Chief Engineer, erstwhile M/S ACC Babcock Limited (ABL) currently M/S Alstom India Limited, impressed upon me the necessity of such book for both institution and industry. I gracefully acknowledge the support extended by M/S Pinaki Nag and Manabendra Mitra Roy for drafting numerous drawings and figures of this book. While preparing the manuscript I extensively searched through various electronic information sources that provide latest information and technology developed globally. One such source that needs special mention is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Myriad collection of information that is frequently visited by me in the course of current pursuit is the Data Center of M/S Development Consultants Private Limited (DCPL). I am indebted to the staff of this Data Center for their guidance. My uncle Mr. Subir K Sarkar, himself a distinguished engineer and an author, extended all kinds of support. I also received regular encouragement from my daughter, Purbita, and son-in-law, Sudip, for writing this book. I am a slow learner in handling modern electronic gadgets, in exploring various software available in the internet and in formatting the manuscript to make it print- able. My son, Krishanu, himself a promising mechanical engineer, guided me at every step and helped me in shaping this book in its present form. My main strength was Anita, my wife, who steered me to write this book and kept the fort under her control all the time. I could engross with my writing without any interference as long as she had been around. I am also indebted to the editorial team of Elsevier, Inc. for their guidance. Special mention is due to Raquel Zanol, Chelsea Johnston, Mariana Kuhl Leme, and Anusha Sambamoorthy in this regard. Dipak K.

    "text": "for their guidance. Special mention is due to Raquel Zanol, Chelsea Johnston, Mariana Kuhl Leme, and Anusha Sambamoorthy in this regard. Dipak K. Sarkar July 03, 2015 xiii PREFACE This book on THERMAL POWER PLANT (cid:1) Design and Operation deals with various aspects of a thermal power plant starting from fundamentals leading in depth to technical treatment. The book is aimed at providing new dimension to the subject and thrust of the book is focused on technology and design aspect with special treatment on plant operating practices and troubleshooting. Certain chapters also deal with numerical problems along with some worked out examples. This book is prepared based on author’s long association with thermal power plants for more than 40 years in design as well as in field engineering. During this long carrier, author has shared his knowledge and experience with students of various technical institutes as visiting faculty in the under graduate level and found that stu- dents are very attentive to his lectures because they found contents of these lectures would be beneficial to their professional carrier. The author also shared his experience with professional engineers under various training schemes, viz. graduate engineers training programme, refreshers training programme, operating personnel training pro- gramme. Against the back drop of feedback received during interaction with engi- neers at various forums, this book aims at sharing author’s experience with much wider group of engineers. The book is so developed as to be used as a core text by Mechanical/Power Engineering students at the undergraduate level and as a special paper on Heat & Work in the Postgraduate level. Diploma engineering students who intend to special- ize in Thermal/Power Engineering can use this as a text book. This book can also be used as a reference book in Power Plant Training Institutes and in Graduate Engineers Training Programme on power plants. To Utility Operators and Design Engineers this book would be of immense help as reference book and to execute day-to-day activi- ties. This book on one side addresses basic design aspects of thermal power plants to make it attractive to students pursuing mechanical/power engineering courses, on the other side it discusses how safely to run these plants so that utility operators find it handy as an useful guide book. Design of a thermal power plant is based on the science of thermodynamics. Chapter 1 deals with treatment on fundamentals of thermodynamics, and comprises vapour cycles, their evolution, merits-demerits and their applications.

Hence, pulverized coal fired boiler is discussed separately in Chapter 4 in view of large global coal reserves and its acceptance as major power producer in many countries. Chapter 5 covers fluidized bed boiler that can burn lower grade of coal and other low grade combustible material for the generation of steam. Steam turbine is the prime mover of steam power plant, and Chapter 6 deals with introduction, type, governing and speed control, losses, performance of steam turbine. For quick start-up and peak load generation, gas turbine is ideal. Chapter 7 covers introduction, combustion system, and performance of gas turbine. This chapter also covers design, benefits, and use of heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that facili- tates improvement of the efficiencyof a gas turbine power plant. Chapter 8 deals with diesel power plant. Its design, equipment, and associated systems are addressed in this chapter. A thermal power plant comprises miscellaneous systems comprising electric power supply and distribution systems, as well as solid (coal, ash), liquid (water, oil, acid, alkali) and gaseous (steam, air, flue gas, natural gas, hydrogen) matter supplyand distri- bution systems. Description and purpose of these systems of a steam power plant are covered in Chapter 9. Operation of modern large power plants is very complex in nature. It requires lot of activities to be executed simultaneously in order to ensure safety of equipment and personnel, as well as stable operation of the unit efficiently. Although discussion on whole gamut of such activities is difficult to be accommodated in this book, an attempt is made to address key aspects of these issues. Thus, Chapter 10 covers auto- matic control of key parameters of steam generator, steam turbine, and regenerative system. Chapter 11 is developed to address interlock & protection system of steam generator, steam turbine, gas turbine, diesel engine, and generator (alternator). While Chapter 12 covers start-up and shut down of steam generator, steam turbine, gas tur- bine, and diesel engine; their abnormal operating conditions are discussed in Chapter 13. Air pollution control is addressed in Chapter 14. This chapter covers emission control of SPM, GHG, SO , and NO generated from a coal-fired steam generator. x x More often than not design engineers get confused and search blindly which code and/or standard are to be followed to design a particular equipment or system.

This chapter covers emission control of SPM, GHG, SO , and NO generated from a coal-fired steam generator. x x More often than not design engineers get confused and search blindly which code and/or standard are to be followed to design a particular equipment or system. Chapter 15 presents purpose, benefits, and a list of commonly used codes and stan- dards for design and operation of thermal power plants. Fossil fuels are basically polluting in nature and are major producer of greenhouse gases causing global warming. Hence, to make these fuels environmentally acceptable cost intensive different types of treatment plants are essential to be installed. Preface xvii To mitigate such complexities and investments, a viable alternative is to adopt renew- able energy sources. These sources do not produce greenhouse gases and are free from emitting toxic wastes. So in continuation to aforementioned chapters, a brief discus- sion on Power from Renewable Energy is addressed under Appendix A. It is more so since renewable energy provides about 16% of global energy consumption. It is of major concern that on one hand global supply of fossil fuels is depleting; on the other hand world’s demand of electricity is rising sharply. As a result, utilities look at nuclear energy as a savior source of bulk power producer. This energy does not produce any air pollution, hence is an attractive alternative in the arena of elec- tricity production even though the reactor area is a potential source of radioactivity and needs special safeguard devices. Appendix B discusses briefly Power from Nuclear Energy. In accordance with current global practice, SI units have been used all through the book. Nevertheless, for the convenience of readers Conversion Factors from SI units to Metric System of units to Imperial & US System of units are addressed under Appendix C. Author would earnestly welcome any suggestion for the improvement of the con- tents of this book both by supplementing with additional information in existing chapters and/or by addressing other areas in consonance with the present intention of this book. These suggestions would be acknowledged gratefully by the author. Dipak K.

The science of thermodynamics also deals with the various systems that are put into service to perform such conver- sions. A system in thermodynamics refers to a definite quantity of matter bounded by a specified region (Figure 1.1), where the transfer and conversion of mass and energy take place. A boundary is a surface that separates the quantityof matter under investiga- tion from its surroundings. While the region may not be fixed in either shape or vol- ume, the boundary either may be a physical one, as the walls of a pressure vessel, or it could be an imaginary surface [1,2]. There are two types of thermodynamic systems: open and closed. In an open sys- tem, mass enters or leaves through the system boundary (Figure 1.2) as in case of “steam flow through a turbine.” In the closed system, mass remains"

In an open sys- tem, mass enters or leaves through the system boundary (Figure 1.2) as in case of “steam flow through a turbine.” In the closed system, mass remains completely within the system boundary throughout the period of thermodynamic study and observation, as in the event of “expansion or compression of steam in a reciprocating steam engine.” In this system, there is no interchange of matter between system and sur- roundings. It is to be noted that in both open and closed systems, heat/work may cross the system boundary [1(cid:1)4]. Thermodynamics also deals with the relations between properties of a substance and quantities of “work” and “heat,” which cause a change of state. Properties of a sub- stance that describe its condition or state are characterized as pressure (P/p), tempera- ture (T), volume (V/v), etc. These properties are measurable and depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle. From a thermodynamic point of view, the state of a system at any given moment is determined by the values of its properties at that moment [1,2,5]. When a system passes through a series of states in a process or series of processes in such a way that the final state of the system becomes identical to its initial state in all respects and is capable of repeating indefinitely then the system has completed a cycle [2]. The same principle is also followed in a thermodynamic cycle in which a fluid is returned to its initial state after the transfer of heat/work across the system boundary ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

However, heat and work are not zero over a cycle, they are process dependent.

While studying the laws of thermodynamics it should also to be kept in mind that the sci- ence of thermodynamics deals with relations between heat and work only. 1.2.1 First law of thermodynamics In a cyclic process, since the initial and final states are identical, the net quantity of heat delivered to the system is proportional to the net quantity of work done by the system.

When heat and work are mutually convertible, we have the first law of ther- modynamics. Mathematically speaking, X X dQN dW ð1:1Þ where Q5Heat supplied to the system, W5Work done by the system. From Eq. 1.1 we can see that the first law of thermodynamics is an expression of the principle of conservation of energy. With the help of this law it is possible to calculate the quantities of heat and work that cross the surroundings of a system when given changes in properties occur. In a more generalized way the first law may be defined as when a system is taken through a cycle, the net work delivered to the surroundings is propor- tional to the net heat taken from the surroundings [2]. As a consequence of the first law, in addition to the pressure, temperature, and vol- ume, another property exists in thermodynamics, such that any change in its magni- tude is equal to the difference between the heat supplied and the work done during any change of state. This property is known as internal energy, denoted by U, and in a thermodynamic cycle change in internal energy (ΔU) is zero. If U represents the 1 energy of the system at the beginning of a process, U its energy on completion of 2 the process, Q the net heat flowing into the system in course of the process, and W the net work done by the system during the process, then the increase in energy of SteamPowerPlantCycles 5 the steady-state open system having one inlet (subscript 1) and one exit (subscript 2), according to the first lawof thermodynamics is expressed as [1,2,4] 1 Q2W 5U 2U 1 ðC22C2Þ1gðZ 2Z Þ ð1:2Þ 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 where C is velocityof the mass at inlet or exit Z is elevation at inlet or exit g is acceleration due to gravity Neglecting the effects of kinetic and potential energies Eq. 1.2 reduces to U 2U 5Q2W ð1:3Þ 2 1 Equation 1.3 reveals that when a system passes through a cyclic process U 5U 2 1 and Q5W. Thus, the net heat flowing to the system equals the net work done by the system, and as a result it is impossible to construct a machine that would operate in a cycle. Consequently, the first law may be stated as it is impossible to construct a per- petual motion machine of the first kind"

Consequently, the first law may be stated as it is impossible to construct a per- petual motion machine of the first kind [2]. [NOTE: The perpetual motion machine of the first kind is one, which once set in motion would continue to run for ever.] Equation 1.3 also reveals that U (cid:1)U depends only on the end states and is inde- 2 1 pendent of the process by which the system is taken from one state to the other. The entire science of thermodynamics is in conformity with this conclusion. Hence, in a process whose end states change infinitesimally, the change in the internal energy of the system may be expressed as dU, the change in heat flow as dQ, and the change in net work done as dW. Accordingly Eq. 1.3 changes to: dU5dQ2dW ð1:4Þ In a constant pressure process, as in steam power cycle, dW5pdV, where p is pres- sure and dV represents the change in volume of the system on completion of the pro- cess, Eq. 1.4 changes to dU5dQ2pdV or, dQ5dU1pdV ð1:5Þ Since p is constant, pdV5d(pV), therefore, Eq. 1.5 may be written as dQ5dU1dðpVÞ or, dQ5dðU1pVÞ ð1:6Þ 6 ThermalPowerPlant In thermodynamics the quantity (U1pV) occurs frequently, and is identified with a special property called enthalpy H.

In its simplest form the second law states that “heat can- not, by itself, flow from lower temperature to a higher temperature.” One of the clas- sical statements of the second law, as given by Kelvin(cid:1)Planck, is “it is impossible to construct a system that will operate in a cycle, extract heat from a reservoir, and do an equivalent amount of work on the surroundings [2].” Another statement of the second law,"

Hence, it may be concluded that, “while the first law states that the net work can never be greater thantheheatsupplied,thesecondlaw goesfurtherandsaysthatworkmustalways be less.” In other words, all heat input to a system cannot be utilized into work, and a part of this heat must be rejected, thereby involving a term called system efficiency.

Suffice it to say that work can be completely and continuously converted to heat, but heat cannot be completely and continuously converted to work, which means within a cycle heat is not entirely available to do work on a continuous basis. This unavailable energy, called anergy, has to be rejected as low-grade heat once the work has been done. The available energy, also known as exergy, on the other hand, is the work output obtainable from a certain heat input in a cyclic heat engine [5]. Consider a system that receives heat Q from a high-temperature (T ) heat H H source, rejects Q to a low-temperature (T ) heat sink, and generates work W while C C operating in a cycle (Figure 1.4). Hence, it can be written that Q 5Q 1W ð1:11Þ H C or, W 5Q 2Q H C or, AE5Q 2UE ð1:12Þ H where, AE5Available energy (exergy) UE5Unavailable energy (anergy) Therefore, the cycle efficiency of the system is defined mathematically as η5Work done/Heat supplied: W Q 2Q 5 5 H C Q Q H H or Q η512 C ð1:13Þ Q H Since both Q and Q are finite, the value of η must be less than 1, even when H C all processes involved are ideal and frictionless.

Consequent to this it may be stated that it is impossible to construct a perpetual motion machine of the second kind. [NOTE: A perpetual motion machine of the second kind is one, which will produce work continuously, while exchanging heat with onlyone reservoir.] [2]. 1.2.2.1 Concept of entropy Fromthefirstlawofthermodynamicsitwasfoundthatthereisanewpropertycalledinter- nalenergy.Likewise,thesecondlawcontainsanother newproperty,whichisfunctionof a quantityofheat,thatshowsthepossibilityofconversionofheatintowork.Thispropertyis a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system’s thermal energy for conversionintomechanicalwork,andisofteninterpretedasthedegreeofdisorderor ran- domness in the system. The name of this property was coined in 1865 by Rudolf Clausius asentropy.Clausiusintroducedtheconceptofentropytofacilitatethestudyoffluidspassing throughareversibleprocess(Section1.3).Anyincreaseinthisnewproperty“entropy”low- ers the availabilityof that energy for doing useful work. In a physical system, entropy pro- videsameasureoftheamountofthermalenergythatcannotbeusedtodowork[1,8,9]. From the entropy of a fluid we may assess the degree of orderly or disorderly motion of its molecules. While condensing steam the degree of order of its molecular motion increases, which in thermodynamics is interpreted as a decrease in the entropy of the fluid. Likewise, when heat is applied to a fluid, its molecules get more agitated, collisions become more frequent, and the degree of motion of molecules become more chaotic, resulting in an increase in entropy. Entropy is not a physical phenomenon that would exist in reality; there is no phys- ical instrument to measure entropy. On the contrary, it is calculated from the pressure and temperature of a fluid at a particular state. It is a thermodynamic property that determines the thermal energy that always flows spontaneously from regions of higher temperature to regions of lower temperature in the form of heat. Like internal energy, the entropyof a system is a function of its end states only [7]. In a Carnot cycle (Section 1.3) the total change in entropy is zero, but when heat flowsfromahotter substancetoacolderone,thehotter substanceloseslessentropythan thecoldersubstancegains(cid:1)thustotalentropyincreases.Inthermodynamics,anincrease in entropy is small when heat is added at high temperature and is greater when heat is added atlower temperature.Hence,inanisolated systemthenecessarycondition for the equilibriumofasystemisthatitsentropyisatitsmaximum.Thus,for maximumentropy thereisminimumavailabilityofheatforconversionintoworkandfor minimumentropy there is maximum availability of heat for conversion into work.

Hence, in a process whose end states change infinitesimally, an “infinitesi- mal change in entropy is equal to an infinitesimal change in heat addition divided by the temperature at which the heat is supplied.” Mathematically the above relationship may be expressed as dS5dQ=T ð1:14Þ Integrating Eq. 1.14 ð dQ=T5ðS 2S Þ ð1:15Þ 2 1 where S5Entropyof the system Q5Heat supplied to the system T5Temperature of the system 2 and 1 stand for final and initial states, respectively.

It is an ideal cycle in which heat is taken at a constant higher temperature and rejected to a 10 ThermalPowerPlant constant lower temperature. This cycle laid the foundation for the second law of ther- modynamics and introduced the concept of reversibility. A reversible process is an ideal process, where the process traverses the same path during forward and backward travel. Both the fluid and its surroundings in a reversible process can be restored to their original states, and work and heat exchanged in one path is restored in the reverse path. In a reversible process, the entropy of the system remains unchanged throughout various states of the process. All real processes, however, are irreversible, although the degree of irreversibility varies among processes. The irreversibility in a process is developed due to mixing, fric- tion, throttling, heat transfer, etc. One irreversible process in a cycle causes the whole cycle to become irreversible. In an irreversible process, the total entropy of the system increases as the process continues. In a Carnot cycle a working fluid takes in heat reversibly from a reservoir (heat source) at a constant higher temperature, T ,"

The maximum value of T is limited to the critical point temperature of 1 647K.Thus,themaximumefficiencytheCarnotcyclemayattainisabout54%. The Carnot cycle is thermodynamically simple, but it is extremely difficult to realize in practice, because the isothermal heat rejection must be stopped at state 3, then subse- quent adiabatic compression of a very wet vapor needs to be carried out to restore it to 12 ThermalPowerPlant its initial state 4. During compression, the liquid gets separated from the vapor and fur- ther compression of the fluid has to work with a non-homogeneous mixture. As such, none of the practical engines operate on this cycle. Nevertheless, the Carnot cycle is an excellent yardstick to compare various thermodynamic cycles on a theoretical basis.

The P-V and T-S diagrams of an ideal Stirling cycle (Figure 1.6) include the following four thermodynamic processes: i. 1-2: Reversible isothermal compression ii. 2-3: Reversible isochoric heat addition iii. 3-4: Reversible isothermal expansion iv. 4-1: Reversible isochoric heat rejection The working medium in a Stirling cycle is a gaseous matter, such as air, helium, hydrogen, etc., instead of water and steam. Like the Carnot cycle all the processes in an ideal Stirling cycle are reversible in nature, hence when the gas is heated the engine produces work or power and when work is supplied to the cycle it works as the refrigerator or the heat pump. When the processes in the Stirling cycle are reversed they act as cryogenerator and the cycle is used in the field of cryogenics to produce extremely low temperatures or to liquefy gases like helium and hydrogen. 1.5 ERICSSON CYCLE The Ericsson cycle is another ideal thermodynamic cycle named after inventor John Ericsson, who designed and built many unique heat engines based on various thermo- dynamic cycles. In the P-Vand T-S diagrams (Figure 1.7) the ideal Ericsson cycle is represented by an area bounded by following two isothermals and two isobaric processes: i. 1-2: Reversible isothermal compression ii. 2-3: Reversible isobaric heat addition iii. 3-4: Reversible isothermal expansion iv. 4-1: Reversible isobaric heat rejection erusserP 3 4 2 1 C=V C=V Temperature Isothermal T =T 3 4 3 4 me Isothermal T =T Constant volu Constant volu me 2 1 2 1 Volume Entropy Figure1.6 Stirlingcycle. 2 3 Isotherm Isotherm al al 1 4 Volume erusserP 14 ThermalPowerPlant Temperature T =T 3 4 3 4 T =T Constant pressure Constant pressure 2 1 2 1 Entropy Figure1.7 Ericssoncycle.

It was William John Macquorn Rankine, after whom the Rankine cycle is named, who first calculated the maximum possible work that could be developed by an engine using dry saturated steam between the pressure limits of the boiler and condenser. The simplest steam cycle using dry saturated steam as the working fluid has the following basic components (Figure 1.8): a. Steam Generator/Boiler b. Steam Turbine c. Condenser d. Boiler Feed Pump The Rankine cycle is an ideal thermodynamic cycle involving the following processes: i. Steam generation in boiler at constant pressure ii. Isentropic expansion in steam turbine iii. Condensation in condenser at constant pressure iv.

Figure 1.9 shows the Rankine cycle in P-Vand T-S diagrams. This cycle assumes that all processes are reversible, i.e., all processes take place without any friction and heat transfers take place across infinitesimal temperature drops. The following states/processes are represented in these diagrams: (cid:129) State 1: Condition of saturated vapor at temperature T and pressure p . 1 1 (cid:129) Process 1-2: The vapor then expands through the turbine reversibly and adiabati- cally (isentropicaly) to temperature at T and pressure at p . 2 2 (cid:129) The turbine generates power at a magnitude much higher than the power required by the boiler feed pump. (cid:129) State 2: The exhaust vapor is usually in the two-phase region at temperature T 2 and pressure p . 2 (cid:129) Process 2-3: The low pressure wet vapor, at temperature T (5T ) and, being a two- 2 3 phase mixture process, at constant pressure p (5p ), is then liquefied in the condenser 2 3 into saturated water and reaches the state 3, thus minimizing thework required by the boilerfeedpump.

As a result 4 3 (h (cid:1)h ) and (h (cid:1) h ) in the Carnot cycle are much smaller than those in the Rankine 1 4 2 3 cycle. Thus, the Rankine cycle offers a lower ideal thermal efficiency for the conver- sion of heat into work than does the Carnot cycle. This conclusion is also evident from Example 1.2 and Example 1.4.

This is because these processes on completion are non-reversible causing entropy to increase during compression in boiler feed pump (the isentropic pro- cess 3-4s increases to process 3-4) as well as during expansion in turbine (the isentropic process 1-2s increases to process 1-2), which further results in an increase in power requiredbytheboilerfeedpumpanddecreaseinpowergeneratedbytheturbine. The irreversibility in a real Rankine cycle is the result of irreversibility in the fol- lowing areas: i. Friction in bearings, etc. ii. Pressure drop in steam and water piping, heat exchangers, bends and valves, etc. iii. Friction in turbine blading and pump resulting in increase in entropy in both iv.

These water droplets are very harsh, particularly at the last few stages of a low-pressure tur- bine. Thus, the efficiency of the turbine starts reducing gradually. This problem is overcome by superheating the vapor at state 1, which will move to the right to state 10 (Figure 1.9) and hence produce less wet vapor after expansion (state 20). However, by superheating the heat addition process in the steam generator is no longer isother- mal and the average temperature of heat reception lies somewhere between that cor- responding to states 1 and 10, i.e., between T and T 0. 1 1 In addition to the higher dryness fraction, another advantage of superheating the steam is that the efficiencyof the real cyclewill also increase, since the cycle receives heat at higher temperature. Improving cycle efficiency almost always involves making a cycle more like a Carnot cycle operating between the same high and low temperature limits. 20 ThermalPowerPlant Nevertheless, the maximum possible temperature of steam in a thermal power plant is restricted by the strength of the available materials for boiler tubes or turbine blades. The real superheat cycle is slightly different from the cycle shown in Figure 1.10. Although the liquid leaves the boiler feed pump at state 4, steam leaves the steam gen- erator, in lieu of a state 1, at state 10 (not shown in the figure), and enters the turbine sg at a different state 10 (not shown in the figure). Further, liquid leaving the boiler feed t pump must be at a higher pressure (p ) than the steam-generator exit steam pressure 4 (p 0 ), which also will have to be higher than the steam pressure at turbine inlet (p 0) 1sg 1t because of friction drops in the heat exchangers, feedwater heaters, pipes connecting boiler feed pump and steam generator, pipes connecting steam generator and turbine, bends, superheater outlet valves, turbine throttle valves, etc. [3]. There would also be heat loss from pipes connecting the steam generator and tur- bine, causing a drop in entropy from state 10sg to state 10t.

Hence, these plants operate on high-pressure and high- temperature steam cycles. However, the problem encountered by raising the turbine inlet pressure is that the steam coming out of the turbine (at state 2, Figure 1.10) is very wet. Water droplets accompanying steam impinge turbine blades and damage the blades severely, impairing the efficiencyof the turbine. For all practical purposes it is unwise to allow steam with dryness fraction less than around 88% to remain in the turbine [7], even though higher-grade low-pressure tur- bine blade materials may accept a lower dryness fraction. Accordingly, with superheating alone, the turbine exhaust dryness fraction will not increase enoughto restrict erosion ofturbine blades. To prevent blade erosion and ineffi- cientturbineoperation,wetsteamissometimesextractedfromtheturbinefromaninter- mediatestageandthenpassedthroughreheater,wheresteambecomesre-superheatedand isreturnedtothenextstageintheturbineforfurtherexpansion(Figure1.11).Thefunda- mental purpose of reheat is not to improve cycle efficiency but to reduce the moisture contentofthevapor intheexhaustoftheturbine.Nevertheless,withreheatingthether- malefficiencyofthecycleincreasessignificantlyascomparedwithnon-reheatcycle. In practice steam is extracted from high-pressure (HP) turbine exhaust, circulated to the boiler for re-superheating or reheating, and returned to the intermediate- pressure (IP) or low-pressure (LP) turbine for further work. Exhaust steam from the HP turbine is called “cold reheat” steam, while reheated steam coming out of the steam generator is known as “hot reheat” steam. Reheating is best suited in high-pressure units since it provides low specific vol- ume of steam, thereby reducing the overall surface area of the reheater along with a consequent reduction in capital expenditure. 22 ThermalPowerPlant From Figure 1.11, neglecting the work input to the boiler feed pump, the work done in reheat cycle is W 5ðh 2h Þ1ðh 2h Þ ð1:29Þ o 3 4 5 6 The heat added in the steam generator Q 5ðh 2h Þ1ðh 2h Þ ð1:30Þ 1 3 2 5 4 Therefore, the efficiencyof the Reheat Rankine cycle is ðh 2h Þ1ðh 2h Þ η 5 3 4 5 6 ð1:31Þ rh ðh 2h Þ1ðh 2h Þ 3 2 5 4 (Note: It should be kept in mind that by increasing the turbine inlet steam tem- perature and accordingly the steam pressure the cycle efficiency will always increase.)

If this additional heat to the feedwater could be transferred reversibly from 1 the steam part of the cycle, then the heat supplied to the boiler would be transferred to the feedwater at a temperature somewhere between T and T . This cycle, where 4 1 efficiency is raised as explained, is known as the regenerative cycle. In this cycle, a specified quantity of energy remains circulating within the cycle, and as a result, irre- versibility in the process of mixing relatively cold water with hot steam gets reduced. The purpose of regeneration or “stage bleeding” is to improve cycle efficiency, which in turn minimizes steam consumption and results in plant efficiency. This is realized by adding regenerative feedheating to the superheat-reheat cycle. Feedheating involves extracting a fraction of the steam flowing through the turbine from one or more positions along the turbine expansion and using heat in the steam to preheat the water in feedwater heaters prior to entering the boiler (Figure 1.12) [3,11,12]. Each unit of extracted steam does a certain amount of work in the turbine from throttle conditions to point of extraction and transfers the remainder of its heat to the feedwater, thus conserving the total heat, instead of losing part of the heat to the cir- culating water passing through the main condenser.

The working fluid in this cycle is a mixture of at least two different fluids (typically water and ammonia). Ammonia has a lower boiling point compared with water. Hence, when the tempera- ture of the mixture increases, the ammonia will boil first. In contrast to this when the mixture is cooled, water will condense first (Figure 1.17) [13,14]. When the mixture begins to boil at 550kPa (state 3) the concentration of ammonia is 70% and water is 30%. As the boiling of mixture continues, the temperature increases and at state 4 the concentration of the remaining fluid and vapor formed are given by states 6 and 5, respectively. On further boiling of the mixture, when it reaches state 7, the mixture is saturated vapor. The concentration of vapor at this point is the same as the concentra- tion of the liquid at the beginning of the evaporation process. Unlike the Rankine cycle, where considerable heat energy is lost in the isothermal vaporization of water to steam, the binary mixture in the Kalina cycle vaporizes non-isothermally, resulting in better performance. Variable temperature boiling permits the working fluid to maintain a temperature closer to that of the combustion gases in the boiler. The use of mixture as the working fluid allows manipulating pressure in the system by changing composition of the mixture.

Increasing the ammo- nia concentration may raise the evaporation pressure. A high ammonia concentration causes a steep increase in pressure. The demands of high ammonia concentration in the working fluid during evaporation and expansion and low ammonia concentration during condensation are met by the distillation and mixing processes. Hightemperatureexhaustfromanyprocess/equipment,e.g.,agasturbine,istheheat source of the ammonia-water mixture for recovering heat [15]. By absorbing heat the mixturevaporizesandthendrivestheturbine.Onpartialcompletionofexpansioninthe turbine, the mixture gets condensed.

Thus, a considerable improvement in cycle efficiency could be achieved provided evaporation takes place at a temperature corresponding to the metallurgical limit of the turbine. There is, however, a constraint. Although steam has a relatively low critical temperature (647.14K), its critical pressure is very high (22.12MPa). As a result, the design becomes critical. The process could be simplified if there is a work- ing fluid whose critical temperature is higher than the metallurgical limit of about 873K, but the vapor pressure of the fluid is moderate [2]. One such working fluid is mercury, with a vapor temperature of 873K at a saturation pressure of only 2.3MPa. It is evident that at a comparable temperature the saturation pressure of mercury is far below that of water. Figure 1.18 and Figure 1.19 [2] show a cycle where mercury in conjunction with steam is used in a binary cycle to harness the benefit of the whole temperature range Hg Turbine W 10,11 Water 10 Economiser W 1,2 Hg Boiler 11 2 Water feed pump Hg condenser 3 9 and 1 steam generator Q 6,4 Steam 4 super heater Steam 8 5 W condeser 5,6 7 W 7,8 Steam 6 Hg feed pump turbine Figure1.18 Flowdiagramofabinaryvaporcycle. 34 ThermalPowerPlant 9 10 Hg 5 T 8 11 7 3 3 4 Water 2 1 6 S Figure1.19 Binaryvaporcycle. beginning with the metallurgical limit down to the atmosphere.

Feedwater heating and superheating of steam after evaporation are performed by the heat of condensation of mercury vapor. From Figure 1.19 it is observed that dry saturated vaporof mercury leaves the mer- cury boiler at state 10 and expands isentropically in the mercury turbine to state 11. A two-phase mixture of mercury vapor-liquid then enters the “mercury condenser- water boiler” heat exchanger to exchange its heat of condensation to water steam and reachesstate7.Thenthemercurypumpraisesitspressuretostate8forfurtherevapora- tioninthemercuryboiler. Water becomes dry saturated vapor in a “mercury condenser-water boiler” at state 4 and then passes through the superheater in the mercury boiler furnace to state 5. Superheated steam then enters the steam turbine, expands isentropically to state 6, and condenses to state 1. Saturated water thereafter is pushed to the boiler to repeat the cycle. Although quite attractive, this cycle is not commercially viable since it suffers from the following disadvantages: i. Mercury vapor is toxic and extremely hazardous. ii. At the normal heat sink temperature of about 300K, the vapor pressure of mer- cury is extremely low and its specific volume is very large. Thus, the vacuum to SteamPowerPlantCycles 35 be maintained in the mercury condenser is exorbitantly high, causing the size of the condenser to be impracticably large. iii. Mercury has low latent heat (about one-eighth of the latent heat of steam), there- fore, specific mercury consumption is high. iv. Capital expenditure of this plant is exorbitant. v. Its maintenance cost is also high.

CHAPTER 2 Steam Generators 2.1 INTRODUCTION Man has used the technique of converting water (liquid) into steam (vapor) and using the expansive force of this vapor as far back as 150 B.C. Yet it took human beings more than 1800 years to harness the practical qualities of steam to do useful work. It was around the year 1711 that the first commercial piston-operated mine pump was invented [1], but it wasn’t until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the first steam-operated central power station was introduced. It was in the year 1882 that Holborn Viaduct power station in London and Pearl Street Station in New York had been put into service using reciprocating steam engines.

The heat of steam is converted to mechanical energy in the steam turbine and then to electricalenergyinthegenerator.ThesequenceoftheseactivitiesisshowninFigure2.1. The chemical energy available in fossil fuel (i.e., coal, fuel oil, gas) is converted to heat energy by combustion in a steam generator. The heat thus liberated is absorbed by continuously feeding water in a combination of heat-transfer surfaces, resulting in a continuous generation of steam. The water fed into a steam generator is called feedwater. Steam and feedwater together is called working fluid. The name “steam generator” is also still called “boiler,” but modern steam generators in the supercritical class do not involve the “boiling” phenomenon. The fuel-firing equipment of a steam generator should completely burn the fuel used in the furnace to release as much energy as possible. Air is fed into the furnace for combustion of fuel-forming products of combustion or flue gas. The heat released by burning fuel is absorbed in different heat-transfer surfaces to the maximum level possible practically and economically to keep the loss of heat to a minimum. In the heating surfaces, the flue gas transfers its heat to the working fluid. Thus, the feed- water is pre-heated to the saturation temperature and vaporized. The saturated steam thus formed is further superheated. After passing over the heating surfaces at various zones the flue gas is cooled and discharged to the atmosphere through a stack.

The primary function of a steam generator is to generate steam under pressure, but modern steam generators are also required to do the following: i. Ensure generation of exceptionally high-purity steam byeliminating all impurities from saturated steam. ii. Raise the degree of superheat of supplied steam as specified and maintain the same temperature over a defined range of load. iii. In large power stations after partial expansion in the turbine steam is returned to the steam generator for further superheating and then transmitted to the turbine for complete expansion. This new degree of superheat is called “reheat” and should also be maintained constant over a defined range of load. iv.

While executing the above duties, a steam generator must utilize the heat of combustion of fuel as efficiently as possible. 2.2 BOILING AND CIRCULATION Boiling of a liquid refers to a condition where vapor bubbles form on the heating surface of the liquid. Formation of bubbles depends on the fluid properties and the operating and surface conditions. When heat is added to a liquid, its temperature does not increase beyond its saturation temperature corresponding to its pressure, instead, the energy used results in a change of phase from a liquid to a gaseous state, e.g., from water to steam. This process, which takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, is known as boiling. The boiling pointof aliquidis defined as thetemperatureat whichits vapor pressure is equal to the pressure of the gas above it. This temperature is also called saturation temperature. In an open vessel the boiling point of a liquid refers to a temperature at which its vapor pressure is equalto the external pressure at one atmosphere. In theevent that the external pressure becomes less than one atmosphere, the boiling point of the liquidgetsreduced.Astheexternalpressurerisesaboveoneatmosphere,theboilingpoint oftheliquidalsostartsrising.Figure2.2showstheboilingpointofwaterasafunctionof the external pressure. Note the boiling temperature of 373K corresponds to a pressure of101.3kPaandtemperatureof473Ktoapressureof1554.0kPa. Boiling occurs when heat is added to the liquid at such a rate that its temperature is at least equal to its saturation temperature corresponding to the total pressure over the free surface of the liquid. If the vessel is open to atmosphere, the vapor displaces the air from its Vapor pressure of water 24,000 22,000 Critical point 20,000 18,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 surface of the liquid entirely, whereas with evaporation the vapor is removed by diffusion. Theheat,whichchangeswatertosteam,iscalledtheheatofevaporationorheatofvaporization. The heat transfer that takes place from the wall to the liquid during boiling is given by the convective heat transfer equation: Q5hAΔT ð2:1Þ where Q: Rate of heat flow, W h: Heat transfer coefficient, W/m2K A: Area across which heat flow takes place, m2 ΔT: Difference in temperature between the heating surface and the temperature of the fluid, K (Log Mean Temperature Difference (lmtd)) The “heat flux” at the heating surface is found from Eq. 2.1 as: Q q5 5hΔT ð2:2Þ A 2.2.1 Pool boiling When a largevolume of liquid is heated bya submerged heating surface and the motion is caused by free convection currents stimulated by agitation of the rising vapor bubbles, )apk( erusserP SteamGenerators 41 16,000 8,000 6,000 Normal boiling point 4,000 Triple point 2,000 0 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 Temperature (K) Figure 2.2 Saturated water/steam pressure versus temperature.

During the course of heating it is noted that a general correla- tionliesbetweenthegraduallyincreasingheatflux,q,fromtheimmersionheaterandthe corresponding temperature difference between the surface of the heater and the bulk of liquid,ΔT.TheresultofsuchcorrelationispresentedinFigure2.3[1]. At point A since the heat flux is very low, no boiling occurs and no bubbles are formed, hence movement of liquid is by natural convection. In the region A-B, phase change takes place only as evaporation at the free surface of liquid that is at the liquid- vapor interface, and the corresponding heat flux is proportional to ΔT4/3 [2]. A further increase in heat flux will result in vapor bubble formation at the hot surface, yet the bulk of the liquid may still be below saturation temperature. The bub- bles,whichforminthehotboundarylayer,condenseastheyriseintothecolderliquid, giving up their latent heat to raise the temperature of thewater. This phase change still occurs because of evaporation at the free surface. Bubble agitation in this region, B-C, isinsignificant,sincethereisonlyaminorchangeintheslopeofthecurve.Theforma- tion and release of the steam bubbles at the metal water interface, with water still wetting the surface, cause ΔT to remain low. This region, wherein heat transfer takes placebynaturalconvection,iscalledsubcoolednucleateboiling[3]. Further risingofheatfluxresultsinrapidformationofalargenumberofbubbleson the hotsurface. Asa result, strong local velocity is encounteredwithin the liquid, caus- ing a further increase in heat transfer. This is the region of nucleate boiling, where the SteamGenerators 43 bulk of the fluid is at saturation temperature and bubbles travel through bulk of the liquid to emerge at the free surface. Beyond point C bubbles do not collapse. This region, C-D, is one of stable boiling, and has a very steep slope. The heat flux is proportionaltoΔTm,where“m”liesbetween2and4[3].Inthisregion,asthesurface temperatureisincreased,theheatfluxalsoincreasesuptoamaximumvalueatpointD. Nucleate boiling is incipient boiling, which is characterized by the growth of bubbles on the heated surface that rise from discrete points on a surface, whose temperature is only slightly above the liquid’s saturation temperature. In general, the number of nucleation sites is increased by an increase in surface temperature. An irregular surface of the boiling vessel (i.e., increased surface roughness) can create additional nucleation sites, while an exceptionally smooth surface, such as glass, lends itself to superheating. Under these conditions, a heated liquid may experience boiling delay and the temperature"

An irregular surface of the boiling vessel (i.e., increased surface roughness) can create additional nucleation sites, while an exceptionally smooth surface, such as glass, lends itself to superheating. Under these conditions, a heated liquid may experience boiling delay and the temperature may go somewhat above the boiling point and fail to boil. Beyond the nucleate boiling region, the bubbles of the steam forming on the hot surface begin to interfere with the flowof water to the surface and eventually coalesce to form a film of superheated steam over part or all of the heating surface. This thin layer or film of vapor has low thermal conductivity and thus insulates the surface and reduces heat transfer and the heat flux, which in turn results in higher metal tempera- ture. When vapor film insulates the surface from the liquid it is called film boiling. Region D-E shows the “onset of film boiling.” At point E bubbles become so large and numerous that liquid has difficulty approaching the surface as the bubbles rise and thus starve the surface of liquid. Consequently there is a sudden jump in heating surface temperature, as shown at point E0. With water at atmospheric pressure, ΔT might be 25K at E and more than 1000K at E0 [2]. At this temperature there is a real danger of heating surface burning out or melting. Hence, point E is known as the burn out point. It is therefore imperative to operate as close as possible to point E that is at point D, without the risk of burn-out. If at point E a situation arises when heat flux would be dependent on the surface temperature, as when a fluid is condensing at variable pressure, it will be possible to reach point F from point E. Region E-F in Figure 2.3 shows unstable film boiling where the vapor blanket alternatelybreaksdownandrecovers.Asaresultthereisadeclineinheatfluxwithincrease insurfacetemperature. Beyond point F, in the region F-G, the vapor film becomes thicker and film boil- ing becomes stable, where heat flux again increases with an increase in ΔT. Heat is transferred by conduction, convection and radiation across the layer of vapor that blankets the heating surface. At this region only evaporation takes place without formation of any bubble. This region thus is identified as stable film boiling one. If now the heat flux is reduced below the value at point G, the conditions do not jump back to E, but follow a path to point F. At this point the vapor film suddenly collapses and conditions revert to those at point H on the nucleate boiling curve. Point D, which is very close to point E, is known as the point"

At this point the vapor film suddenly collapses and conditions revert to those at point H on the nucleate boiling curve. Point D, which is very close to point E, is known as the point of departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) or the “critical heat flux.” Heat flux at D is extremely high, as 44 ThermalPowerPlant for example with water at atmospheric pressure heat flux is about 1500kW/m2 [2]. The temperature difference, ΔT, between the boiling liquid and the heating surface at which the critical heat flux occurs, is known as the critical temperature difference. During operation of the boiler it is difficult to theoretically predict the heat trans- fer coefficients of nucleate boiling that would ensure ΔT remains below the critical temperature difference. Nevertheless, the ability to predict the value of the maximum heat flux, q , i.e., point E in Figure 2.3, is also useful as this represents an upper max limit in the nucleate boiling heat transfer. The following formula, from Roshenow and Griffith, gives the value of q in SI units, i.e., W/m2 [3]. max q =ðρ (cid:2)λÞ50:0121(cid:2)fðρ 2ρ Þ=ρ g0:6 ð2:3Þ max V L V V where ρ : Densityof liquid, kg/m3 L ρ : Densityof vapor, kg/m3 V λ: Latent heat of the fluid, kJ/kg Once the critical heat flux data is determined it is compared with the required heat flux data.

This method of generating vapor is known as forced-convection boiling. The nature of boiling in forced convection is similar to pool boiling in many ways like the regimes of nucleate or film boiling. The most important difference is in the cause of “burn-out,” since the vapor and liquid must travel simultaneously through the tube. As a result both heat transfer and pressure drop are affected by the behavior of the two-phase flow, which keeps on changing along the tube due to gradual evaporation of liquid.

In the process, some or all of the following regions are encountered by the flow system (Figure 2.4): 1. A liquid heating region or a subcooled boiling region: in this region bubbles are formed at the tube surface but subsequently collapse within the liquid. The heat transfer to the liquid will be by natural convection. 2. A saturated nucleate boiling region: where forced convection dominates. This is the region in which the local tube surface temperature is sufficiently superheated corresponding to the local pressure, causing bubbles to form at the surface. 3.

In these regions in turbulent flow the phenomena of heat transfer to water and to superheated steam in pipes is described by the Dittus-Boelter equation as follows [3].

This is accomplished by maintaining adequate supplyof liquid to avoid the occurrence of DNB. As heating continues, the liquid phase changes tovapor and the DNB point (point D in Figure 2.3) is reached, which is also the end point of the nucleate boiling. The metal temperature starts increasing at this point until point E is reached. In the region E-F, the metal temperature decreases, but increases again in the superheat region beyond point F. In the event the applied heat flux exceeds the critical heat flux, which is a function of pressure, the DNB would occur at low steam qualitycausingthemetaltemperaturetobehighenoughtomeltthetube. In an optimistic design, in most boilers, ΔT is of the order of 3(cid:3)6K, which is well below the critical temperature difference of water at point E, i.e., about 25K at Boiler drum Bottom header atmospheric pressure. Thus ensuring the design value of heat flux is much lower than the maximum value or the critical heat flux. 2.2.4 Circulation In drum-type subcritical boilers, water flows from the drum through downcomers to the bottom of the furnace, then moves up through risers or evaporator tubes and returns to the drum. From Figure 2.5 it can be seen that the water in the downco- mers does not receive any heat while risers, which form furnace walls, absorb the heat of combustion of the fuel. As a result, the water inside the riser tubes is heated and gradually steam bubbles form in the water. This mixture of water and steam in the riser tubes has a much lower density than the density of water alone in the downco- mers. A density difference thus generated results in a static head difference causing thermo-siphon effect, which provides the driving force for a downward flow in downcomers and an upward flow in risers. Since the flow of fluid is generated by density difference alone, this is known as natural circulation in boilers [1,4,5]."

    "text": "density difference thus generated results in a static head difference causing thermo-siphon effect, which provides the driving force for a downward flow in downcomers and an upward flow in risers. Since the flow of fluid is generated by density difference alone, this is known as natural circulation in boilers [1,4,5]. For maintaining continuous circulation of fluid, the fluid flow must overcome friction losses in downcomer and riser tubes, headers, bends, etc. One way of overcoming resis- tance due to friction is by increasing heat input to the furnace.

Water density (d L) increases the density difference between the fluid in the downcomers and the fluid in the risersalsoincreases,resultinginanincreaseinfluidflow.However,anincreaseinfluidflow in turn also causes an increase in friction loss. As a result, a point is reached when the rate of increase in friction loss surpasses the benefit of the enhanced density difference, where the rate of fluid flow starts to “drop.” Hence, all natural circulation boilers are designed to operatebelowthepointof“drop.”Thephenomenonofrisingflow-risingheatinputtends to make a natural circulation boiler self-compensating in the case of sudden overloads, changesinheat-absorbingsurfacecondition,non-uniformburnerdisposition,etc. As the operating pressure of fluid is increased, the density difference between the saturatedliquidandthesaturatedvapor startsdiminishingandreducestozeroatcritical pressure, as is evident from Figure 2.6. Thus it becomes imperative to raise the height oftheboilerhighertomaintainadequatecirculationwithhigher-pressureboilers. In practice, at 18MPa or higher fluid pressure the density difference is so small that it is difficult to maintain natural circulation, even after substantially increasing the height of the boiler. In such cases the fluid flow in the boiler tubes is ensured with the help of assisted or forced circulation. In assisted or forced circulation, pumps are incorporated in the downcomer circuit to help natural circulation overcome friction losses. Downcomer tubes from the boilerdrum are connected to a common header that serves as the suction header of the pumps. Discharge piping of these pumps is then connected to another header from which riser tubes are issued.

The salient features of this heat-transfer process encompasses the following circuits, systems, and/ or areas: a. Water and Steam Circuit b. Furnace c. Fuel-burning System d. Draft System e. Heat Recovery System 2.3.1 Water and steam circuit At operating pressure, temperature of the feedwater, prior to entering the steam gen- erator, is less than that at the saturated condition, i.e., the entering feedwater is under the subcooled condition. Within the steam generator, the feedwater temperature is elevated to the near-saturation temperature in the economizer. Thereafter, the sensible heat for bringing the feedwater to saturation and the latent heat for evaporation of saturated feedwater is added in the water-wall for generating steam. This steam is separated from the steam-water mixture coming out from the water-wall and purified in the boiler drum to ensure the supply of saturated steam. The saturated steam is further superheated to attain the desired energy level. The heat-transfer surfaces discussed so far, e.g., economizer, water-wall, superhea- ters/reheaters, etc., are located in the steam generator in the flow path of products of combustion so that heat is absorbed efficiently in proper proportions in various heat transfer zones. The evaporation zones are comprised of the boiler drum, downcomers, and riser tubes or simply risers. While the boiler drum and downcomers are located outside the heat transfer zone, the riser tubes are exposed to heat transfer. While flowing through the riser tubes the feedwater receives the heat of combustion for evaporation. The riser tubes in modern steam generators are arranged such that they form the enclosure of the combustion chamber or furnace and receive the heat. Hence, riser tubes are usually called water-walls.

The feedwater from the economizer enters the boiler drum, flows down through the downcomers, passes through the pipes to the water-wall bottom header and rises through the riser tubes. In the riser tubes, the feedwater absorbs the heat, part of which is converted to steam and re-enters the boiler drum as a steam-water mixture. From this mixture, steam is separated in the boiler drum and purified. Dry saturated steam from the boiler drum is lead out through the saturated steam pipes to the super- heaters. The complete flow path of working fluid is shown in Figure 2.7. The process of separation and purification of steam in the boiler drum is accom- plished by drum internals, e.g., cyclones, baffles, etc., chemical and feedwater admission piping, blow-down lines, etc. (Figure 2.8). The process includes three steps: separation, steam washing, and scrubbing. Separation is the process of removing the bulk mass of water from steam and is accomplished by anyone of following means: (cid:129) Gravity (cid:129) Abrupt change in flow direction (cid:129) Centrifugal action (cid:129) Impact against a plate (cid:129) Use of baffles 52 ThermalPowerPlant Superheater connecting tubes Drying Screen Secondary Separators Recommended R S b p l i a n d n e er water level I Primary S separators Feed E water pipe R S Chemical feed piping Continuous blowdown piping Down comer Figure2.8 Druminternals.

To avoid re-entrainment of water, velocity is kept low. The collected water drips to the boiler water below by gravity. The arrangement of drum internals must be such as to ensure the following [1,3]: i. Provide high-purity steam to prevent salt deposition in superheaters ii.

The location of superheaters and reheaters in the flue-gas path are normally split into primary and secondary sections to facilitate reasonably unchanged steam temperature control. 2.3.2 Furnace In the furnace of a steam generator combustion of fuel takes place with atmospheric air to release heat. Hence, it is essential to ensure complete combustion of fuel under all operating conditions to harness the maximum heat potential of the fuel under combus- tion.(DetailedtreatmentofthisprocessisincludedinChapter3,FuelsandCombustion.) 2.3.3 Fuel-burning system The primary function of a fuel-burning system is to provide controlled and efficient conversion of chemical energy of the fossil fuel into heat energy. The heat energy thus generated is transferred to the heat-adsorbing surfaces of the steam generator. The main equipment for firing fossil fuel in a furnace is the burner. An ideal fuel-burning system in a furnace is characterized by the following: a. No excess oxygen or unburned fuel in the product of combustion b. Low rate of auxiliary ignition energy input to initiate and sustain continuity of combustion reaction c. Wide and stable firing range d. Fast response to demand for a change in firing rate e. Uniform distribution of flue-gas weight and temperature in relation to parallel circuits of heat-absorbing surface f. High degree of equipment availability with low maintenance requirement g. Safety must be the main requirement under all operating conditions 2.3.4 Draft system For sustaining a healthy combustion process in a furnace it needs to receive a steady flow of air and at the same time remove products of combustion from the furnace without any interruption. When only a chimney is used for the release of products of combustion, the system is called a natural draft system. When the chimney is aug- mented with forced draft (FD) fans and/or induced draft (ID) fans the system is called a mechanical draft system. Small steam generators use natural draft, while large steam generators need mechanical draft to move large volumes of air and gas against flow resistance. A furnace utilizing an FD fan only is subjected to “positive draft” (pressur- ized), while one using an ID fan only is subjected to “negative draft” (subatmospheric pressure). Normally large coal-fired steam generators utilize balanced draft, employing both FD fans and ID fans. Figure 2.9 presents the flow path of a typical balanced draft furnace. Sec.

SH Reheater Furnace 2.3.5 Heat recovery system The flue gas or products of combustion leaving the convection heat-adsorbing surfaces in large steam generators still carry considerable heat energy at a temperature much above the steam saturation temperature. This heat, if exhausted to atmosphere without further heat transfer, will result in considerable losses. As a natural consequence of economic operation of a steam generator, a major part of this heat is recovered by placing the economizer thereafter the air heater in the exit flue-gas path. Theoretically it is possible to reduce the flue-gas temperature to that of the incom- ing air to the air heater, but for technical and economic considerations, as described below, such reduction in exit flue-gas temperature is prohibited. i. All fossil fuels are sulfur-bearing fuels. As such, if the exit flue-gas temperature from the air heater falls below the acid dew point of the as-fired fuel, sulfurous or sulfuric acid will form, causing back-end corrosion in the air heater. As a consequence, both maintenance cost and plant outages will increase. ii. Capital costs incurred for installing additional heat recovery surfaces may offset the savings obtained by reducing flue-gas temperature. In an economizer the incoming feedwater absorbs heat from the exiting flue gases, raising the temperature of the feedwater as close as possible but lower than its satura- tion temperature prior to entering into the evaporating circuit. The remaining heat in flue gas downstream of the economizer is recovered in air heater to raise the temperature of combustion air before it enters the furnace.

As the name suggests, its general construction is as a tank of water perforated by tubes that carry hot flue gases from the fire. The tank is usually cylindrical in shape to realize the maximum strength from simple structural geometry. The tank may be installed either horizontallyor vertically. Typically the furnace and the grate, on which fuel is burnt, are located underneath the front end of the shell (Figure 2.10). The gases pass horizontally to the rear, then either release through the stack at the rear or reverse directions and pass through the horizontal tubes to stack at the front. The fire tubes can be placed horizontally or verticallyor at an inclined plane in a furnace. In this type of boiler boiling takes place in the same compartment where water is stored. As a result, only saturated steam used to be produced in older designs of this type of boiler, but today, a fire-tube boiler may generate superheated steam as well.

The difference in density occurs because the water expands as it is heated, and thus, becomes less dense. All natural circulation boilers are drum-type boilers. 2.4.4 Forced/assisted circulation boiler As noted in section 2.2 the density difference between the saturated liquid and saturated vapor starts diminishing at 18MPa or higher fluid pressure, thus it is difficult to maintain natural circulation of fluid flow in boiler tubes.

In such cases fluid flow is ensured with the help of forced/assisted circulation using pumps. The forced/assisted circulation principle applies equally in both supercritical and subcritical ranges. 2.4.5 Subcritical boiler and supercritical boiler The critical pressure is the vapor pressure of a fluid at the critical temperature above which distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. As the critical temperature is approached, the properties of the gas and liquid phases become the same, resulting in onlyone phase. The point at which the critical temperature and critical pressure is met is called the critical point. The critical pressure and critical temperature of water and steam are 22.12MPa and 647.14K, respectively. Any boiler that operates below the critical point is called a subcritical boiler, and one that operates above the critical point isknownasasupercriticalboiler.(Supercriticalboilersarecoveredinsection2.10.) 2.4.6 Drum-type boiler In a drum-type boiler the drum acts as a reservoir for the working fluid. These boilers have one or more water drums, depending on the size and steam-generating capacity. The drum is connected to cold downcomers and hot riser tubes through which circulation of working media takes place. The lower portion of the drum with feed- water is called the water space and the upper portion of the drum occupied by steam is called the steam space. A drum-type boiler can be either the natural circulation type or forced/assisted circulation type. Drum-type boilers are essentially subcritical boilers; they operate below the critical pressure of the working fluid. The economic design pressure limit of fluid in a drum-type boiler is around 18MPa. 2.4.7 Once-through boiler This typeof boilerdoes not have a drum. Simply put, a once-through boiler is merelya length of tube through which water is pumped, heat is applied, and the water is SteamGenerators 59 converted into steam. In actual practice, the single tube is replaced by numerous small tubes arranged to provide effective heat transfer, similar to the arrangement in a drum- type boiler. The fundamental difference lies in the heat-absorbing circuit. Feedwater in thistypeofboilerentersthebottomofeachtubeanddischargesassteamfromthetopof the tube. The working fluid passes through each tube only once and water is continu- ously converted to steam. As a result there is no distinct boundary between the econo- mizing, evaporating, and superheating zones.

This type of boiler was capable of burning a wide range of coals, from bituminous to lignite, as well as byproducts of waste fuels. However, over the years this type of boiler has become less popular due to more efficient technological advancement. In stoker-fired boilers coal is pushed, dropped, or thrown on to a grate to form a fuel-bed. Stokers are divided into two general classes: overfeed, in which fuel is fed from above, and underfeed, wherein fuel is fed from below. Under the active fuel-bed there is a layer of fuel ash, which along with air flow through the grate keeps metal parts at allowable operating temperatures.

These fuels can generate a substantial quantity of heat by reacting with oxygen. These fuels consist of a large number of complex compounds comprised of five principal elements: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N). Any of these three fuels, i.e., coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, can be used in steam power stations, but coal plays a large role in power generation because of the enormous reserves of coal in many countries around the world, e.g., the United States, China, Mongolia, India, Indonesia, Russia, Poland, South Africa, Australia, etc. Most of the large steam- generating stations in these countries are coal based, and coal is expected to remain a SteamGenerators 61 dominant fuel for this purpose for many years.

Coal-fired power plants at present account for about 41% of power produced globally [9]. Coal-based steam-generating stations also dominate in those countries where natu- ral gas and fuel oil are abundantly available, since the cost of natural gas and fuel oil is exorbitantly high compared to the cost of coal. Additionally, natural gas and fuel oil are more economical in other industries. In modern, large-capacity, coal-fired steam generators coal is burnt in suspension. (Pulverized coal-fired boilers are covered in more depth in Chapter 4.) 2.4.10 Fluidized-bed boiler Fluidized-bed combustion ensures burning of solid fuel in suspension, in a hot inert solid-bed material of sand, limestone, refractory, or ash, with high heat transfer to the furnace and low combustion temperatures (1075(cid:3)1225K). The combustor-bed material consists of only 3(cid:3)5% coal. Fluidized-bed combustion is comprised of a mixture of particles suspended in an upwardly flowing gas stream, the combination of which exhibits fluid-like properties. Fluidized-bed combustors are capable of firing a wide range of solid fuels with varying heating value, ash content, and moisture content. In this type of boiler, pollutants in products of combustion are reduced concurrently with combustion (cid:3) much of the ash and hence the particulate matter as well as sulfur is removed during the combustion process. Further, lower temperature combustion in the fluidized bed results in lower production of NO and obviates any slagging problem. (Fluidized- X bed boilers are covered in Chapter 5.) 2.4.11 Waste-heat recovery boiler A waste-heat recovery boiler (WHRB) or a heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a gas stream and in turn produces steam that can be used in a process or to drive steam turbines. A common application for HRSGs is in a combined cycle power plant (CCPP), where hot exhaust gas from a gas turbine is fed totheHRSGtogeneratesteam.(ThesetypesofboilersarediscussedinChapter7.) 2.5 BOILER MOUNTING AND ACCESSORIES Equipment that are directly attached to, or within, the boiler are generally called boiler mountings. They are essential for safety, economics, and convenience. These mountings includewater-levelgauges,safetyor reliefvalves,drainandblow-downvalves,ventvalves, water and steam sample connections, stop-check valves, soot blowers, etc. Accessories for measuring boiler-operating conditions include pressure gauges, water-level gauges, thermometers, thermocouples, water and steam flow meters, alarms, etc. There are also 62 ThermalPowerPlant combustion control equipment and measuring devices.

The control equipment for automatic water-level controls should be such as to regulate the feedwater supply to the boiler to effectively maintain the level of water in the boiler drum according to the pre-determined limits. Automatic firing controls should effectively control the supply of fuel and air to the combustion equipment at all times. It is necessary to maintain complete control over the combustion process based on the quantity of CO, CO , or O in the flue 2 2 gases. The combustion equipment should shut off the fuel supply to burners or the fuel and air supply to the furnace under the following conditions [11]: a. Flamefailureorpilotflamefailureincasesofgas,oil,orpulverizedfuel-firedboilers b. Failure to ignite fuel at the burner within a pre-determined time c. Fall in drum water level below a pre-determined safe level d. Failure of forced draft or induced draft fans or any automatic flue damper e. Increase or decrease in furnace pressure to a pre-determined value Each boiler is also provided with steam/water/air soot blowers to dislodge soot and fly ash from the fireside passages of the boiler. 2.6 SUPERHEATERS AND REHEATERS Thesuperheater isoneofthemostcriticalelementsof aboiler plant.Sinceitislocated inthehigh-temperaturezoneitacquiresclosetothehighestvalueofsteamtemperature asallowedbythemetallurgicallimit.Theaveragetemperatureatwhichheatissupplied is increased by the superheating and hence the ideal cycle efficiency is increased and accordinglyspecificsteamconsumption(kg/kW.s)decreases. The efficiencyof an un-superheated cycle does not increase continuously with boiler pressure up to the critical pressure, but reaches the maximum when the pressure is about 16MPa; thereafter, it drops with an increase in pressure. This is due to the fact that the latent heat and the quantity of heat transferred at higher temperature becomes smaller as thepressureincreases.Eventually,theeffectiveaveragetemperatureatwhichheatisadded startstodecreaseandtheefficiencyfalls.Inconstrasttotheefficiencyofanun-superheated cycle,theefficiencyofthesuperheatedcycleincreasescontinuouslywithpressure. Furthermore, the dryness fraction at the steam turbine exhaust of an un- superheated cycle reduces as the boiler pressure is increased, resulting in the formation of droplets in the steam that erode the turbine blades and also reduce the turbine isentropic efficiency. To avoid these problems, the dryness fraction of steam is not allowed to fall below about 88% when passing the steam through superheater [12]. 64 ThermalPowerPlant Even though superheating increases the dryness fraction, with the current operat- ing steam temperature of about 810K or above it is sometimes difficult to maintain the dryness fraction at or above 88%, particularly in large units. This problem is circumvented by adding another heat transfer surface called a “reheater” in the flue- gas path. With a combined superheat-reheat arrangement, the steam expands in the turbine at two different pressure stages. The steam coming from the superheater expands in the high-pressure turbine to some intermediate pressure. The low- temperature exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine is then passed through the reheater in the steam generator to"

The steam coming from the superheater expands in the high-pressure turbine to some intermediate pressure. The low- temperature exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine is then passed through the reheater in the steam generator to raise the steam temperature at a constant pressure to a level equal or higher than the superheat steam temperature. The reheated steam is then fed to the intermediate pressure turbine. The superheater and reheater heat transfer surfaces absorb heat from the products of combustion or flue gases either through radiation, i.e., they receive heat through radia- tion from the furnace or through convection, which means these surfaces receive heat from the hot flue gas from the furnace by convection heat transfer [13]. Accordingly, these heat transfer surfaces are called “radiant type” or “convection type.” 2.6.1 Convection superheater/reheater Convection superheater/reheater heating surfaces are placed above or behind the banks of water tubes at the rear of the radiant heating surfaces to protect them from combustion flames and high temperatures. The main mode of heat transfer between the flue gases and the convection superheater/reheater tubes is convection. With an increase in steam demand, both fuel and air flow increase, resulting in an increase in flue-gas flow. As a result, convective heat transfer coefficients increase both inside and outside the tubes. The overall heat transfer coefficient between gas and steam hence increases faster than the increase in mass flow rate of steam. Thus, steam receives greater heat transfer per unit mass flow rate and the steam temperature increases with the load as shown in Figure 2.14. 2.6.2 Radiant superheater/reheater Some sections of superheaters and reheaters are placed closer to the higher- temperature zone of the combustion flames for greater heat absorption. With this placement of the superheater/reheater sections, the heat transfer between the hot flue gases and the flame and the outer surface of the tubes takes place by radiation. Hence, these heating surfaces are called “radiant superheater/reheaters” [14]. From fundamental heat transfer theory it is known that radiation heat transfer is pro- portional to (T4 (cid:3)T4 ), where T is the flame absolute temperature and T is flame tube flame tube the tube surface absolute temperature. However, T is much greater than T and is flame tube also not dependent on load. As a result, the heat transfer is distinctly proportional to Convective Radiant 20 40 60 T4 and the resulting heat transfer per unit mass of flow decreases as the steam flow flame increases. Hence, an increase in steam flow due to enhanced load demand would cause the final steam temperature to fall, which is opposite of that experienced by the"

Hence, an increase in steam flow due to enhanced load demand would cause the final steam temperature to fall, which is opposite of that experienced by the convec- tion superheater/reheater (Figure 2.14). To allow radiation through radiant heating sur- faces theyare arranged in flat panels or platen sections with wide spacing. 2.7 ECONOMIZERS In a subcritical boiler, the temperature of flue gases that leave steam-generating surfaces is determined by the saturation temperature of boiling water. The higher the steam pressure the higher the saturation temperature. Therefore, to permit the exchange of heat from flue gases to steam-generating surfaces, the temperature of flue gases must be above the saturation temperature of the water and is generally main- tained at around 648(cid:3)818K. At this high temperature if the flue gases are exhausted to atmosphere, the loss in boiler efficiency will be exorbitantly high and unacceptable. Hence, there is an opportunity to absorb the residual heat of flue gases leaving the superheater and reheater by the incoming subcooled feedwater in a separate heat transfer surface known as the “economizer.” With this type of additional heat absorp- tion the working fluid efficiency of the boiler also is enhanced substantially. For each 5.5K increase in the feedwater temperature, the boiler efficiency rises by about 1%. For each 22K drop in flue gas temperature, there is an increase in boiler efficiency by 1% in a conventional boiler [1]. erutarepmet maetS SteamGenerators 65 Combined 80 100 Steam flow, % Figure2.14 Steamtemperatureversussteamflow. 66 ThermalPowerPlant When flue gases travel across water-walls and superheaters only the latent heat and superheat of steam are supplied by the flue gases. The primary state of this latent heat is accomplished in the economizer, which is placed in series with the feedwater heaters of the regenerative system. The function of the economizer is, therefore, to raise the temperature of feedwater downstream of the highest pressure feedwater heater to the saturation temperature corresponding to the boiler pressure. The economizer, comprised of a bank of tubes over which flue gases pass, is a forced flow convection heat exchanger through which feedwater is supplied at a pres- sure higher than the pressure at the evaporating section. The size of the economizer is dictated by a comparative analysis of its costs and savings of fuel due to improvement in thermal performance. Economizer size is also governed by the temperature of the feedwater at the economizer inlet and the temperature of the exit flue gas from the economizer. With very low feedwater temperature, there is a possibility of external corrosion of economizer tubes due to the"

Economizer size is also governed by the temperature of the feedwater at the economizer inlet and the temperature of the exit flue gas from the economizer. With very low feedwater temperature, there is a possibility of external corrosion of economizer tubes due to the condensation of flue-gas constituents passing over them if the surface temperature of the tubes falls below the acid or water dew point of the flue-gas stream. In the event that the feedwater contains a significant amount of dissolved oxygen (.7ppb (parts per billion) in high-pressure boilers) pitting and corrosion may take place inside the tubes. This problem is overcome by deaerating the feedwater and maintaining a pH of around 9. An economizer may be designed as follows [5]: a.

The steam content of water at the economizer outlet should not exceed 20% of the feedwater flow at full load, and should be lower at part loads. When feedwater make-up is low, it is advantageous to produce part of the steam in an economizer rather than in the evaporating section. From commercial point of view steaming is not allowed in the economizer, since there is the possibility of tube failure due to two phase flows through the tubes. 2.7.3 Plain-tube economizer In some designs of boilers a continuous loop-type economizer is used. Tubes of this type of economizer have relatively small diameter to escalate the magnitude of heat transfer and to minimize fouling. 2.7.4 Finned-tube Economizer (Figure 2.19) Heat absorption in the economizer tubes may also be intensified by welding fins to the plain tubes on the flue-gas side. This type of arrangement helps make the economizer compact, and it also increases the use of metal per unit heating surface area, providing muchmoregaininheatabsorptionandrequiringsmallerspace.Thesetypesofeconomi- zersaremoresuitedtogaseousandliquidfuel-firedboilersandincombinedcycleplants.

This type of economizer is basically a horizontal steel-tube economizer, one end of which is bent 180(cid:4) and the other end is equipped with a special flange bolted with a return-bend fitting. 2.7.6 Staggered-tube economizer (Figure 2.20) A staggered arrangement of economizer tubes is preferable for gas and oil-fired boilers. This arrangement provides ascending motion of the feedwater in the economizer, resulting infreereleaseof fluegases enteringfromthetopoftheeconomizer tubesand flowing down across the staggered tubes leaving at the bottom. This economizer is not suitable for coal-fired boilers. In a coal-fired boiler tubes must be in line to allow free flowofashchunksthroughthebankoftubes. 2.8 AIR HEATERS The temperature of flue gases downstream of the economizer is still quite high (588(cid:3)698K). The remaining heat in these flue gases is trapped in another heat- absorbing surface called the air heater. The air heater uses a colder heat-receiving fluid SteamGenerators 71 (ambient air) and thus the outlet flue-gas temperature from the air heater is reduced to about 393(cid:3)433K, while the temperature of ambient air is raised from atmospheric to about 523(cid:3)613K prior to using this hot air in combustion. The heat recoveredis recycled to the furnace by the combustion air and is added to the energy released from the fuel. This higher heat energy is further absorbed in the evaporating and/or the superheating surfaces, resulting in gain in boiler efficiency and less fuel consumption for the same output.

This higher heat energy is further absorbed in the evaporating and/or the superheating surfaces, resulting in gain in boiler efficiency and less fuel consumption for the same output. The fuel savings are almost directly propor- tional to the rise in air-heater outlet air temperature. For a 110K air temperature rise, typical fuel savings are about 4% and for a 280K air temperature rise, fuel savings are about 11% [14]. Beyond fuel savings, air pre-heating is also required for drying coal in thepulverizer.Thetypicalairtemperaturefordryingcoalrangesfrom423(cid:3)588K. When considering the principle of operation there are two types of air heaters: recuperative or regenerative. Both recuperative and regenerative air heaters may be arranged in vertical or horizontal configuration. The heat transfer efficiency of regen- erative air heaters is high compared to the efficiency of recuperative air heaters. However, the disadvantages of regenerative air heaters are leakage of air into the gas space and transport of fly ash into the combustion air system. 2.8.1 Recuperative air heater (Figure 2.21) In a recuperative air heater, heat from the flue gases is transferred continuously to air through a heating surface. In this type of air heater the metal parts are stationary and heat is transferred by conduction through the metal wall. A commonly used recupera- tive air heater is the tubular type, but for lower air and flue-gas pressures the air heater can also be the plate type. Tubular air heaters are normally the counter-flow shell-and-tube type where hot flue gases pass through the inside of the tubes and air flows outside. Baffles are provided to ensure maximum air contact with hot tubes. These heaters, however, consume much metal and occupy a large space. 2.8.2 Regenerative air heater In a regenerative air heater, the heating surface is swept alternately by the flue gas and the air undergoes alternate heating and cooling cycles and transferring of heat by thermal storage capacity of the heat transfer surfaces. The gas and air counter-current flows move through the rotor separately and continuously. Thus, when half of the heating elements are exposed to flue gases at any instant, the other half is exposed to air. This air heater may include either rotating heat transfer surfaces with stationary air/gas distribution hoods (Ljungstrom design: Figure 2.22) or rotating air/gas distri- bution hoods, where the heat transfer surfaces are stationary (Rothemuhle design: Figure 2.23). 72 ThermalPowerPlant Tubesheet expansion joint Gas inlet Tubesheet Hot end section Tubes Air outlet Flow separator and anti-vibration baffle Air bypass for cold end Support temperature members control Air inlet Cold end section Gas outlet Dust and water wash hopper Figure 2.21 Recuperative air heater.

In a Rothemuhle air heater the storage elements are stationary and the gas and air ducts are connected to two rotating segments each [1]. The principle of heat transfer from hot gas to cold air is identical to that of the Ljungstrom air heater. Ljungstrom air heaters, however, are better for commercial use due to better heat transfer and lower leakage, sometimes less than 5%. Whiletheyprovidesubstantialfuelsavings,airheatersarepronetocommonproblems asdiscussedinthefollowing. 74 ThermalPowerPlant 2.8.2.1 Leakage Leakageisanormalphenomenoninallairheaters.Whileleakageinanewrecuperative air heater is essentially zero, leakage occurs with the passage of time and due to accumulation of thermal cycles. Nevertheless, leakage in a recuperative air heater can berestrictedto3%withregular maintenance. With a rotary regenerative air heater air leakage is inherent and its design value ranges from 5(cid:3)10%, which increases further over time as seals wear. When the higher-pressure air side passes to the lower-pressure gas side leakage occurs through the gaps between rotating and stationary parts. The rate of such leakage is given by the following expression [1]: W 5KAð2gΔPρÞ0:5 ð2:8Þ L where W 5Leakage flow rate, kg/s L K5Discharge coefficient (generally 0.4(cid:3)1.0) A5Flow area, m2 g5Acceleration due to gravity (1kgm/Ns2) ΔP5Pressure differential across gap, kg/m2 ρ5Densityof leaking air, kg/m3 Ambient air infiltration through holes, doors, gaskets, expansion joints, etc., into lower-pressure gas streamsis another form of air-heater leakage.

The formation of moisture in the cold end may cause corrosion and fouling. These adverse effects are exacerbated in units firing sulfur-bearing fuels. Upon combustion of the fuel, its sulfur content is oxidized to form SO , a portion of which is converted 2 to SO that combines with the moisture to form sulfuric acid vapor. This vapor 3 condenses on surfaces at temperatures below its dew point of 393(cid:3)423K, resulting in potential corrosion in the cold end of the air heater. The obvious solution would be to operate at cold-end metal temperatures above the acid dew point, but this results in unacceptable boiler heat losses. In practice, air heaters are designed to operate the same at minimum metal temperature (MMT), therefore, the resulting increase in boiler efficiency offsets the additional maintenance cost needed to prevent low-temperature gas corrosion. Some typical recommendations of leading boiler manufacturers regarding limiting MMTs while burning sulfur-bearing fuels are given in Figure 2.24 and Figure 2.25. A generally accepted method of preventing gas corrosion is to raise the inlet temperature of the air in the steam coil air heater. Another method of overcoming corrosion is to apply corrosion-resistant coatings to low-temperature elements of an 400 389 Oil and gas 377 366 Coal 355 344 333 322 0 1.0 2.0 3.0 Sulfur in fuel, % by wt K ,erutarepmet latem muminiM SteamGenerators 75 ∗ Use 339K for sulfur free natural gas 4.0 5.0 6.0 Figure 2.24 Minimum metal temperature versus sulfur (regenerative air heater).

Most air-heater fires occur during start-up when unburned fuel oil, deposited on ash-fouled heating surfaces, is ignited. Fire can be prevented by maintaining a clean air heater surface by resorting to soot blowing during start-up as well as prior to shut-down of the boiler. Today air heaters are also provided with automatic fire-extinguishing systems. 2.9 INSULATION All hot surfaces at temperatures above 333K must be insulated for personal protec- tion. The thickness of insulation is chosen to ensure a maximum external surface temperature of 328K for metal surfaces and 333K for non-metallic surfaces. In addition to personal protection, insulation is also applied to flue-gas paths and flue- gas ducts to ensure the flue-gas temperature entering the chimney remains above its acid dew point to prevent low-temperature gas corrosion. Additionally, thermal insulation is applied to a steam generator to ensure the steam is supplied to its point of application at the correct temperature without any drop.

SteamGenerators 77 piping and vessels are also applied with insulation to ensure maximum transfer of heat and minimum heat loss from surfaces. 2.9.1 Thermal insulation materials There are four types of thermal insulation materials: granular, fibrous, cellular, and reflective. Granular materials, such as calcium silicate, contain air entrained in the matrix. Fibrous materials, such as mineral wool, contain air between fibers. Cellular materials, e.g., cellular glass and foamed plastics, contain small air or gas cells sealed or partly sealed from each other. Reflective insulation materials consist of numerous layers of spaced thin-sheet material of low emissivity, such as aluminum foil, stainless- steel foil, etc. In practice, a combination of two or more of the above four types are used. 2.9.1.1 Properties of thermal insulation materials Heat from a hot surface is transferred or lost through an insulation material to the surrounding area by radiation and convection. Thermal insulation should limit the heat loss to a minimum. The main requirement of thermal insulation materials is “low thermal conductivity” since heat is transferred through insulation material by conduction (at 373K, thermal conductivity of mineral wool is 0.047W/m.K, that of glass fiber is 0.038W/m.K, of calcium silicate is 0.057W/m.K and of magnesia"

Density difference between liquid and vapor is zero iii. Specific enthalpy difference between liquid and vapor is zero As heat is applied to water above the critical pressure, the temperature rises, water molecules are gradually agitated, inter-molecular space increases uniformly, and fluid becomes less dense. Thus, at the critical point the liquid and gas phases of any fluid become a single supercritical phase. The transition from the dense-phase water with a compact molecular arrangement to a wide-spaced random arrangement of vapor is uniform. No internal bubbles are formed. Specific enthalpy changes uniformly and all other physical properties change continuously from liquid to vapor state with a gradual rise in temperature. Near to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density. Thus, the density difference between the liquid and vapor phases reduces sharply. The benefit of adopting supercritical technology in fossil fuel-fired power plants is not restricted to improvement in generating efficiency alone. Efficient operation of supercritical power plants leads to burning less fuel and consequently less SO , NO , X X and CO emissions, which would in turn reduce global warming as well. The relative 2 improvement in efficiency that can be achieved with a supercritical plant compared to a subcritical plant is presented in Table 2.2. 2.10.2 Steam-water circuit Supercritical boilers do not have boiler drums. This type of boiler consists of a num- ber of parallel circuits connected by inlet and outlet headers. Pressurized water enters the circuit at one end and leaves as superheated steam at the other end (Figure 2.26).

Therefore, regardless of load it is necessary to ensure adequate flow of fluid within individual tubes so that the wall temperature does not exceed the allowable metaltemperature limit.To meetthisrequirement belowtheminimumload, the supercritical boiler operates in circulation mode and needs a separator and circula- tion system for water-steam separation. Fluid coming from the evaporator enters the separatorvessel,andtheseparatedwater iscirculatedbacktotheboiler. There are two types of circulation systems in use today. In the first type, the separated water from the separator is led to the deaerator and is circulated to the feedwater system through the boiler feed pump. This system is simple and relatively inexpensive but involves loss of heat. In the other type of system a circulation pump is provided to circulate the water from the separator directly to the economizer (Figure 2.27). This prevents heat loss but increases cost. From the separator vessel all fluid is routed through the pipes to the convection enclosure, similar to a subcritical design. There may be two to three stages of super- heaters with interstage desuperheater for temperature control.

Another way of ensuring each tube of evaporator receives uniform total heat input above the minimum load is to deploy either inclined smooth tubes spiraled around the furnace enclosure (Figure 2.28) or a vertical wall furnace with rifled tubes (Figure 2.29). Spiral construction of tubes provides the following benefits: 1. For the same cross-sectional heat receiving area the number of inclined tubes is less than the number of vertical tubes to envelope the furnace without increasing the spacing between the tubes. 2. Uniform heat absorption in each tube renders the spiral wall system less sensitive to changes in the heat absorption profile in the furnace. 3. Increased mass flow rate of water in the tubes to a value that will prevent the DNB at partial loads, so there is no risk of tube starvation, and overheating is lim- ited due to the critical heat flux/dry-out. It also equalizes the heat absorbed by water-wall tubes and thus limits the tube-to-tube temperature unbalance at the outlet of the furnace water-wall circuit (Figure 2.30).

Hence, this cycle has to essentially use single reheat, and if the high-pressure turbine inlet temperature is low (813K or less) and pressure is high (above 26MPa) double reheat may also be required. 2.10.4 Special features 1. Supercritical boilers are essentially once-through boilers because of a gradual change in density from the liquid phase to the vapor phase. Hence, storage vessel of subcritical boiler, i.e., boiler drum, is no longer valid for the supercritical one. 86 ThermalPowerPlant 2. The volume of the evaporator system of a once-through boiler is much smaller compared with a natural circulation boiler. Due to smaller inventory of stored water and steam, the theoretical rate of response on the load changes of a super- critical unit is much faster than for the drum unit. 3. These boilers are better suited for frequent load variations than drum-type boilers, since the drum is a component with a high wall thickness, requiring controlled heating. Therefore, pressure changes in a supercritical boiler can be achieved more easily, and these boilers require 15(cid:3)20% less cold start-up time compared with that needed for subcritical boilers of the same size. 4. A once-through boiler does not have any boiler blow-down, therefore, less waste water is disposed of and eventually condensate make-up is usually significantly less. 5. In a supercritical unit the main steam temperature is controlled by the water-fuel ratio control with back-up spray attemperation. As a result,"

However, development continued in the 1970s and 1980sininlandEuropeandJapantoexplorethebenefitsofsupercriticaltechnology. It should also be noted that the former USSR was not far behind the United States in the use of supercritical technology. Thefirstsupercritical power plant with a capacity of 300MW was commissioned in the USSR in 1963, and the first 800MWunit was put into operation in 1968. Unlike the United States, the USSR approach toward adopting supercritical steam conditions was quite modest, while steam pressure was raised to 25.5MPa, superheat steam temperature was kept the same as that of the sub- critical plants, i.e., 818K, and the reheat steam temperature was either the same as the superheattemperatureorslightlyhigher,at818(cid:3)838K.Theworld’slargestsupercritical unitwithacapacityof1200MWhasbeenoperatingintheUSSRsince1980[16]. From the 1980s on, the technology got so matured that currently there are more than 600 supercritical power plants operating in the United States, Russia, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Japan, China, Korea, South Africa, India, Australia, and Taiwan. Power producers in other countries are also embarking on supercritical technology. 88 ThermalPowerPlant When considering supercritical steam conditions research shows that the industry is predominantly adopting a superheat steam pressure in the range of 24(cid:3)31MPa, with superheat/reheat steam temperatures in the range of 838(cid:3)883K [17]. In the near future the focus will likely be on adopting steam conditions of 31(cid:3)32MPa and 893K/893K with the ultimate goal of reaching ultra-supercritical steam conditions of 34(cid:3)36MPa pressure and 973/993K temperature [17]. 2.11 PROBLEMS 2.1 Steam is generated at a pressure of 10MPa with 150K superheat.

CHAPTER 3 Fuels and Combustion 3.1 INTRODUCTION Any matter that is a source of heat is called fuel [1]. Fuel releases its energy either through a chemical reaction, such as during combustion, or via nuclear fission or fusion. An important property of a useful fuel is that its energy can be stored and released only when needed, and that the release is controlled in such a way that the energy can be harnessed to produce the desired work. Fuels are broadly classified as fossil or organic or chemical fuel, nuclear fuel, and rocket fuel. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons, primarily coal and petroleum (liquid petroleum or natural gas), formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by expo- sure to heat and pressure in the earth’s crust over hundreds of millions of years. Fossil fuels generate substantial quantities of heat per unit of mass or volume by reacting with an oxidant in a combustion process. In most practical applications including combustion in a steam generator, air is used as the oxidant, although in certain pro- cesses oxygen, oxygen-enriched air and other chemicals are used as the oxidant. Energy generation by a nuclear fuel takes place either by the process of nuclear fis- sion of heavy fissile elements in a nuclear reactor resulting in chain reactions or by the process of nuclear fusion, in which simple atomic nuclei are fused together to form complex nuclei, as in case of fusion of hydrogen isotopes to form helium. The process of nuclear fusion is also known as a thermonuclear reaction, which is difficult to con- trol even today. As a result, the main source of nuclear energy presently available is mainly from nuclear fission. The most common fissile radioactive heavy metals are naturally occurring isotope of uranium, U235, artificial isotope of uranium, U233, and artificial element plutonium, P239. In a nuclear reactor plutonium, P239, is produced from naturally occurring isotope of uranium, U238, and U233 is produced from the naturally occurring element thorium, Th232. Nuclear fission of 1kg of U235 generates about 85(cid:1)106MJ of heat, which is equivalent to the heat generated by combustion of about 5(cid:1)106kg of coal with a high heating value (HHV) of 17MJ/kg. In nuclear reactions, the product is either isotopes of the reactants or other nuclei. Unlike fossil fuel, rocket fuel does not depend on its surroundings for the oxidant. The oxidant is carried by the rocket itself. The propellant is the chemical mixture burned"

Unlike fossil fuel, rocket fuel does not depend on its surroundings for the oxidant. The oxidant is carried by the rocket itself. The propellant is the chemical mixture burned to produce thrust in rockets and consists of a fuel and an oxidizer. Propellants are classified according to their state (cid:3) liquid, solid, or hybrid. In a liquid-propellant ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

Liquid propellants used in rocketry can be highly refined kerosene, liquid hydrogen (LH ), liquid meth- 2 ane, etc. Solid propellant motors are the simplest of all rocket designs. Unlike liquid propellant engines, solid propellant motors cannot be shut down. Once ignited, they will burn until all the propellant is exhausted. The fuel is generally aluminum and the propellant is ammonium perchlorate. In hybrid propellant engines fuel is generally solid and the oxidizer is liquid. Besides availability of energy from various form of fuels, energy is also available from sun, wind, tides, geothermal, biomass, etc., which are broadly called renewable sources of energy. Commercial use of such energy at present, however, is not large scale in many countries. 3.2 SOURCES OF CHEMICAL ENERGY In steam power plants, fossil fuels that produce large quantities of heat economically have been used for combustion. These fuels are abundantly available in nature and their extraction process is reasonably simple. Most widely used fossil fuels for the pro- duction of steam in relation to power are available in all the states of matter, e.g., gaseous(cid:3)natural gas, blast furnace gas, coke-oven gas, liquefied petroleum gas or (LPG), etc., liquid (cid:3) high-speed diesel (HSD), light diesel oil (LDO), heavy fuel oil (HFO), furnace oil (FO), low sulfur heavy stock (LSHS), naphtha, liquefied natural gas (LNG), etc., and solid(cid:3)bituminous coal, anthracite, lignite, peat, oil shale, bio- mass, etc. Fossil fuels consist of a large number of complex compounds of five elements: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N). Besides these elements, all fuels contain mineral matter (A) and moisture (M) to some extent. However, there are just three combustible elements of significance in a fuel, e.g., carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur, of which carbon is the principal combustible element with a HHVof 32.780MJ/kg. Hydrogen has avery high HHVof 141.953MJ/kg, but its con- tent in solid fuel is quite low, about 2(cid:3)4%. The HHVof sulfur is only 9.257MJ/kg, hence as a source of heat its presence is insignificant, although it is more so since its"

The HHVof sulfur is only 9.257MJ/kg, hence as a source of heat its presence is insignificant, although it is more so since its presence in coal is small in quantity. Major concern regarding sulfur is that it promotes corrosion and creates atmospheric pollution problems. Contrary to solid and liquid fuels, gaseous fuels are mixtures of combustible and non-combustible gases. NFPA 85 defines natural gas as “A gaseous fuel occurring in nature and consisting mostly of organic compounds, normally methane (CH ), ethane 4 (C H ), propane (C H ), and butane (C H ) [2]. The calorific value of natural gas 2 6 3 8 4 10 varies between 26.1 and 55.9MJ/m3, the majority averaging 37.3 MJ/m3.” Natural FuelsandCombustion 93 gas on average contains 80(cid:3)90% methane, 6(cid:3)9% ethane, and 2(cid:3)5% propane. Non- combustible gases present in minor quantities in natural gases are nitrogen (0.5(cid:3)2.0%) and carbon dioxide (0.1(cid:3)1.0%). LPG, as per NFPA 85, is “A material composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons or mixtures of them: propane, propylene, n-butane, isobutene, and butylenes” [2]. The mixture is liquefied at room temperature at very high pressure. An average mixture of LPG is comprised of about 80% butane and about 20% propane. In addition to these fuels, other fuels have also been used as sources of chemical energy for combustion. Some of these fuels are coke, peat, bagasse, tars and char, wood, rice husk, producer gas (product received by burning coal or coke in air defi- cient environment in presence of controlled amount of moisture), water gas (produced by passing steam through a bed of hot coke; the product contains mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide), etc. 3.2.1 Heating value The heating value of a fuel is the amount of heat recovered when the products of com- plete combustion of a unit quantity of fuel are cooled to the initial temperature (298K) of the air and fuel. As the heating value of fuel increases, the heat content delivered to the burners increases. The heat of combustion of a fuel is also called its potential heat. When a fuel is burned in oxygen saturated with water vapor, the quantity of heat released is known as the high heating value (HHV), or gross calorific value (GCV), of fuel. When the latent heat of water vapor contained in the combustion products is subtracted from the HHV we get the low heating value (LHV) or net calorific value (NCV) of fuel. In a laboratory, the HHVs of solid and liquid fuels are determined at constant volume and those of gaseous"

The majority of countries is not rich in coal production. There are around 70 countries that contain recoverable coal reserves. The largest producer of hard coal is the People’s Republic of China (about 3561(cid:1)109kg was produced in the year 2013) [3], followed by the United States, India, Indonesia, Australia, Russia, and South Africa. Germany, Poland, and Kazakhstan also contribute to global coal production to some extent. The largest producer of lignite (brown coal) is Germany (about 183(cid:1)109kg pro- duced in the year 2013). Russia, the United States, Poland, Turkey, Australia, Greece, and India also produce lignite. Coal is the major fuel used to generate over 40% of the world’s electricity demand and provides 30% of global primary energy needs. Coal is also used in the production of 70% of the world’s steel [3]. Almost all (93% or more) electricity-generating stations in Mongolia and South Africa are coal-fired [3]. Other countriesthat dependheavilyon coalforelectricitygenerationarePoland,thePeople’s Republic of China, India, Australia, Israel, Indonesia, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Globally about 7823(cid:1)109kg of hard coal and brown coal were produced in the year 2013. At the current production level, proven coal reserves are estimated to last 134.5 years as estimated by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), and the World Energy Council (WEC) reportsthatthecoalreservesleftareequivalentto113yearsofcoaloutput[3].

There is also petroleum in oil sands (tar sands). Petroleum deposits can be found in almost all parts of the world, but commercial exploration stretches from Indonesia throughout Mayanmar, India, the Middle East, Central Europe, Africa, to North and South America. Over 50% of the world’s oil reserves are in the Middle East. As of 2012, the known reserves of petroleum are typicallyestimated to be around 210.5(cid:1)109m3. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world’s energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia, up to a high of 53% for the Middle East. Other geographic region consumption patterns are as follows: South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). More than 110 countries produce petroleum globally. According to Businessinsider, the largest supplier of petroleum oil in the year 2012 was Saudi Arabia, followed by the United States, Russia, Iran, People’s Republic of China, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Kuwait, Iraq, Venezuela, Nigeria, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Libya [4].

Venezuela also has FuelsandCombustion 95 large amounts of oil in the Orinoco oil sands. Canada and Venezuela contain an esti- mated 570(cid:1)109m3 of bitumen and extra-heavyoil. Oil shales are found in many countries, but the United States has the world’s larg- est deposits. Oil shales can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure in a process called destructive distillation. The world at large consumes 4.8(cid:1)109m3 of oil per year, and the top oil consumers largely consist of developed nations. In fact, 21% of global petroleum consumption is from the United States. Other countries that are large consumers of petroleum are the European Union, People’s Republic of China, Japan, Russia, Germany, and India. (Note: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela are jointly known as OPEC: Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.) Natural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of gas tur- bines and steam turbines in combined cycle modes. Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, and produces less carbon dioxide per unit energy released.

It is a fossil fuel or an organic sedimentary rock, formed by the result of temperature and pressure on plant debris; it is far more plentiful than oil or gas. Coal is comprised of a complex mixture of organic chemical substances containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, together with small amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, and trace elements such as mercury, selenium, arsenic, fluorine, etc. It also contains various amounts of moisture and minerals. 96 ThermalPowerPlant The different grades of coal include peat, lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, semi- anthracite, and anthracite.

Peat is the earliest formation of coal from decomposition of organic matter. With increasing depth and increasing temperature this peat changes into lignite. These low rankcoalsgraduallybecomematurewithfurther increaseintemperatureandmoretime. Mature forms of coal (cid:3) such as “bituminous” (soft) and “anthracite” (hard) (cid:3) contain more carbon and less moisture, while, the most immature forms of coal (cid:3)“peat” and “lignite”(cid:3) contain the high moisture and lowest carbon. Anthracite is a hard coal comprised of mainly carbon with little volatile matter. Its moisture content is negligibly small. On the other side of the scale is lignite, which is a very soft coal whose constituents are mainly moisture and volatile matter with very little presence of fixed carbon.

On the other side of the scale is lignite, which is a very soft coal whose constituents are mainly moisture and volatile matter with very little presence of fixed carbon. Because of the wide variation in constituents of different forms of coal it is impor- tant to know the various characteristics of coal, as discussed in the following, since they affect the burning of coal in a power plant [1]. It is also important to remember that burning an unsuitable coal can reduce the efficiencyof a power plant with conse- quent increase in pollutant emissions. Caking, coking Anessentialpropertyofcoalthatisimportantfor theproductionof coke is caking. When caking coals are heated they soften, swell, become plastic, then form lightweight, porous coke particles. These coals are also called agglomerating coals (free swelling index of 1 or greater). They can easily float out of the furnace before they are burned, unless pulverization is sufficiently fine. [NOTE: The ‘free swelling index’ is determined by heating 1 gm of coal sample for a specified time and temperature. The shapeofthebuttonformedbythesamplecoalisthencomparedtoasetofstandardbut- tons. Larger formed button indicates higher swelling index. Oxidized coal tends to have lowerswellingindex.Thisindexcanbeusedtoshowcakingpropertiesofcoal.][6]. Coal that shows little or no fusing action is called free-burning coal. Free-burning coals do not have the same swelling characteristic (free swelling index of 0.5 or less) and, hence, do not require the same degree of pulverization. Sub-bituminous coals and lignite are classified as free-burning coals. Both caking and free-burning coals can be burned without difficulty in pulverized coal-fired boilers. When heated at uniformly increasing temperature in an air-less furnace or oven or in an atmosphere very deficient in oxygen, the volatile matter of coal is driven off, leaving behind a residue of fixed carbon and ash. During heating in the range of 620(cid:3)670K coal softens and the residue fuses into a solid mass. This is called coke, which is suitable for metallurgical processes. Caking and coking coals generally have loweroxygen content than free-burning and non-cokingcoals.Allcokingcoalsarecaking,butnotallcakingcoalsaresuitableascoke. FuelsandCombustion 97 Reactivity of coal The reactivity or rate of combustion of coal is defined as the rate at which coal combines with oxygen at temperatures above the ignition point. During the progress of heating, a portion of the inherent oxygen of coal also becomes available to the oxidation process. As the oxygen level increases, the fuel reactivity increases. Reactivity is influenced by the particle size as well as by the surface area to mass ratio of the particle.

When coal ash is heated, it becomes soft and sticky, as the temperature continues to raise it becomes fluid. Ash-fusibility temperature is measured by heating cones of ash in a furnace arranged to produce either oxidizing or reducing atmosphere. The temperature at which the tip of the cone starts to deform is known as the initial- deformation temperature (IDT). The temperature at which the cone fuses down into a round lump, in which the height is equal to the width at the base, is called the soften- ing temperature (ST). The temperature at which the cone has fused down to a hemi- spherical lump, where the height of the cone equals one half the width of the base, is known as the hemispherical temperature. When the melted cone spreads out in a flat layer, the temperature is called the fluid temperature. The softening temperature serves as the single best indicator of clinkering and slagging tendencies under given fuel-bed and furnace conditions. If ash arrives at a heat-absorbing surface at its softening temperature, the resulting deposit is likely to be porous in structure, and may either fall off metal surfaces by its own weight or be removed by soot blowing. If such a deposit builds up in a high-temperature zone, its surface can reach its melting point and then run down the wall surfaces. The temperature differential between initial deformation and fluid temperatures, if small, indicates that the wall slag will be thin, runny, adhesive, and sticky. This type of slag is extremely difficult to control by soot blowing. As the differential temperature increases, the resulting slag deposit will build up to thicker proportions, which is less adhesive and therefore responds better to removal by soot blowing. Sulfur Sulfur in coal exists in three forms: organic, pyritic, and sulfate. Sulfur that is an inherent constituent of coal is organic sulfur, which is considered as a non- removable impurity. Pyritic sulfur occurs primarily as pyrite or mercasite. Sulfate sul- fur usuallyexists as calcium sulfate or iron sulfate. When coal is burned, sulfur oxides form and emit through the stack. However, the quantityof sulfur oxides emission to atmosphere should comply with local air pol- lution control regulations. In addition to its air-polluting properties, sulfur also plays a role in promoting cor- rosion of air heaters, economizers, and stacks. Sulfur"

In addition to its air-polluting properties, sulfur also plays a role in promoting cor- rosion of air heaters, economizers, and stacks. Sulfur oxides, when combined with 98 ThermalPowerPlant moisture in combustion air form acids that may be deposited when the combustion gas is cooled below its dew-point temperature. Sulfur also contributes to clinkering and slagging, and to spontaneous combustion of stored coal. 3.4.1 Analysis of coal The two different methods of analyzing coal are known as ultimate and proximate. Ultimate analysis determines the proportion of the main chemical elements contained in the coal, i.e., carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbonate contents. The oxygen may be determined chemically but usually is estimated by difference. Thus, the results of ultimate analysis are important since they facilitate combustion calculations. This analysis provides information regarding the primary combustible and non-combustible components that are used to compute combustion air requirements, flue-gas volumes, and the losses associated with the combustion of hydrogen whose latent heat of evaporation is lostwith thegas.The resultsofultimateanalysis are given invarious cate- gories, e.g., on a “as received,” “air dried,” “dry,” “dry ash-free,” or “dry mineral matter free” basis. Conversion from one analysis report to another is presented in Table 3.1. The results of proximate analysis provide information regarding moisture, ash, volatile matter, and by difference, the fixed carbon content of coal. The higher the value of volatile matter the easier the ignition of fuel. On the other hand, the fixed carbon is the main heat generator during the burning of coal. The major contributor to the heating value of coal is fixed carbon together with the amount of volatile mat- ter content of coal. Proximate analysis of coal in combination with its calorific value facilitates the design of the furnace including burner locations along with determining the quantum of coal required for generating a quantityof steam. Moisture All coal contains some natural moisture, since all coals are mined wet. This natural moisture is called inherent moisture and it lies in the pores of the coal and remains within the coal after it is air-dried. Surface moisture, on the other hand, depends on conditions in the mine and the weather during transit. The surface mois- ture may be removed from coal by heating it to 373(cid:3)378K. Moisture is generally determined quantitatively in two steps: by air-drying and oven-drying. The air-dried component of total moisture is required in the design and selection of coal-handling and coal-preparation equipment. High moisture content may cause serious difficulties in the fuel combustion process. It reduces the heating value of fuel,"

It also results in higher heat losses with flue gases and raises power consumption of induced draft fans. Surface moisture adversely affects pulverizer performance. In the event coal dust is over-dried, it is liable to self-ignite in places where it is stored or accumulates and may become explosive when mixed with air.

Ash is chiefly comprised of SiO , Al O , 2 2 3 Fe O , CaO, with smaller amounts of TiO , MgO, K O, Na O, SO , P O , etc. 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 5 While ferric oxide, lime, magnesia, potassium oxide and sodium oxide are basic components of ash, silica, alumina and titania are acidic components. The ash-fusion temperature increases as the “percentage of acidic components” increases or the “percentage of basic components” becomes very high or low. As dis- cussed earlier high fusion temperatures result in low slagging potential, while high slagging potential is the consequence of low fusion temperatures. A low ash fusion temperature is not suitable for pulverized coal firing as the “furnace exit gas tempera- ture” (FEGT) will have to be too low, resulting in a slagging problem in the furnace. The mineral matter in the ash plays a significant role in the slagging, fouling, erosion, and corrosion of components exposed to the combustion gases. The slagging index of ash can be determined by using the following formula: ðSum of Basic ComponentsÞ;% Slagging Index5 ð3:3Þ ðSum of Acidic ComponentsÞ;% Ash affects fuel selection and the design and sizing of the furnace and other coal quality-dependent components. The properties of ash also play an important part in the operation of a steam generator.

Ash also increases shipping and handling costs. Volatile matter When dry coal is heated gradually in an inert medium in the absence of air, the total loss of weight is called the volatile matter. During the process of combustion it is driven off in gaseous form from coal. The yield of volatile matter from coal takes place at a temperature range of 383(cid:3)1373K, and the highest yield takes place at around 1073K. This is the principal indicator of the reactivity of a coal, and for predicting ignitability and flame stability. Volatile matter is comprised of combustible gases, such as methane and other hydrocarbons, hydrogen, oxygen and carbon monoxide, and non-combustible gases. It affects the firing mechanism, furnace volume, and arrangement of heating surfaces. High-volatile coals ignite more readily than low-volatile coals. High-volatile coals need less-fine pulverization than do low-volatile coals. Low-volatile coals, except anthracite, have higher grindabilities, because they are softer. Fixed carbon The fixed carbon is that portion of coal that remains as residue after volatile matter distills off, after the sum of moisture and ash content in the coal is FuelsandCombustion 101 subtracted. It is essentially carbon, but contains minor quantity of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur not driven off with the gases. In a combustion process this is the combustible residue left after the volatile matter distills off. In general, the fixed carbon represents the portion of the coal that must be burned in a solid state. Knowledge of fixed carbon helps in the selection of combustion equipment, since its form and hardness are an indication of the caking properties of a fuel. 3.5 OTHER SOLID FUELS Some of the solid fuels that find wide industrial applications are described in the fol- lowing. None of these fuels, however, can be used as a source of energy in large util- ity power plants. 3.5.1 Biomass Biomass is an organic matter that has been in use since human beings started burning wood to make fires. It is a source of renewable energy derived from plant material, urban garbage, and animal waste. It can regrow over a relatively short period of time. Biomass can be used directly through combustion or indirectly by converting it to biofuel. Biomass is produced from solar energy by photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants convert CO from the air and water from the ground into car- 2 bohydrates, which on"

Through the process of photosynthesis plants convert CO from the air and water from the ground into car- 2 bohydrates, which on combustion gets back to CO and water along with the release 2 of solar energy absorbed during photosynthesis. In many developing countries biomass is the only source of domestic fuel. Wood is the largest source of biomass energy. Rotting garbage and agricultural and animal waste all release methane gas. The potential of algae and water hyacinth as a source of biomass is under research. It is believed that the use of biomass as an alternative source of energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions because the carbon dioxide released into atmosphere by using biomass is recovered again by the growth of new biomass. In contrast, the use of fossil fuels increases greenhouse gas emission without any recovery. Some of the biomass used to generate bio-power includes the following: i. Agricultural wastes, e.g., wheat straw, rice husk, jute stick, etc. ii. Energy crops, e.g., bagasse, bamboo, special type of grass, e.g., switchgrass, etc. iii. Wood and forest residues, e.g., dry leaves, twigs, etc. iv. Wood wastes, e.g., sawdust, wood shavings v. Clean industrial and municipal wastes vi. Cattle dung, poultry litter, etc. 102 ThermalPowerPlant 3.5.2 Peat Peat is the earliest formation of coal from decomposition and disintegration of wetland vegetation, e.g., bogs, mosses, sedges, shrubs, and other plants, yet it is not considered a coal or a fossil fuel. Peat forms when plant material, in wetlands, where flooding obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, is prevented from decaying fully. It is partially carbonized vegetable matter saturated with water. The moisture content of peat is more than 75%. Peatland features can include ponds, ridges, and raised bogs. Large deposits of peat are found in Canada, People’s Republic of China, Russia, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and the United States. Peat is friable and its quality is variable. It can be ignited easily, it burns freely releasing intense heat, and its color ranges from yellowish to dark-brown to black. Peat is not considered a renewable source of energy. With increasing depth and increasing temperature peat changes into lignite. Bog is wet spongy ground of decomposing vegetation, which can be cut and dried and used as fuel. Sedge is grass like plant having solid stems and narrow leaves that grows in wetlands. 3.5.3 Charcoal Charcoal is the light-black residue left on heating wood or other organic substances such as saw dust, coconut shell, bark, bamboo, etc., in the absence of air.

Charcoal is comprised of mainly pure carbon with varying amounts of hydrogen, oxygen, and ash. It can be ignited easily. The heating value of charcoal is higher than that of wood. It is also lighter than wood, thus transport costs are lower. It is used as a cook- ing fuel, in smelting metal ores, in explosives, and as an absorbent of gases and liquids from solutions. Wood charcoal is also used as a component of gun powder. 3.6 PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS Initsnaturalstatepetroleumisgenerallyabrownish-greentoblackliquidwithadensityof 0.80(cid:3)0.95at288K.Althoughpetroleumisliquid,fromitsformationitmayalsoinclude natural gas.

Crude from this stage distills further in secondary or atmospheric stage to separate heavy gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, light gas oil, and heavy gas oil. Residue from the atmospheric stage is put in the third or vacuum stage, thereby separating fuel oil blends, distillates for lubricating oil, bitumen, etc. Distillation of coal tar that is rich in aromatic hydrocarbons yields benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. Coal tar is thick, dark, and oily liquid and is obtained by coal carbonization. Modern civilization depends heavily on petroleum for the pro- duction of chemicals, fertilizers, dyestuffs, detergents, fibres, plastics, etc. Almost all internal combustion engines run on petroleum yield fuels. Petroleum products are also used in ovens and furnaces. Replacement of solid fuels by liquid and gaseous fuels improves the operating conditions of power stations and reduces the cost of the equip- ment substantially and increases efficiency of the stations. However, these benefits are achieved at the expense of exorbitantly high running cost. 3.6.1 Liquid fuels Different types of liquid fuels obtained as products from petroleum refineries include the following. Gasoline Liquid fuel that is used in a reciprocating spark-ignition internal com- bustion engine is called gasoline. Gasoline is broadly classified as motor gasoline and aviation gasoline. Motor gasoline is a complex mixture of low boiling hydrocarbons. Low boiling hydrocarbons usually cause vapor lock in engines and hence are not suitable for use in aircraft engines. Motor gasoline has a lower octane rating than avia- tion gasoline. Because of its use in aircraft engines, volatility of aviation gasoline is higher than that of motor gasoline. 104 ThermalPowerPlant Jet fuel Because of its low freezing point and wider boiling point, commercial jet airlines run on this fuel. The vapor pressure of jet fuel is quite low (14(cid:3)20kPa at 311K). Antioxidants, metal deactivators, and corrosion inhibitors are used as additives in jet fuel. This fuel has some bearing with kerosene. Kerosene The volatility of kerosene is lower than that of gasoline. Kerosene is basically paraffin used for burning in oil lamps and stoves. It is obtained as a straight- run distillate from crude petroleum after gasoline is recovered. Diesel fuel The characteristics of diesel fuel vary from heavy kerosene to residual fuels. Diesel fuel is rich in aromatics and iso-paraffins. Ignition quality, cleanliness, and viscosity are the important properties of diesel fuel that determine its use in high- speed engines. Use of diesel fuel in diesel engines is attractive because of its low cost, even though the maintenance cost is high. Fuel oil There are five commercial grades of fuel oil, also"

Use of diesel fuel in diesel engines is attractive because of its low cost, even though the maintenance cost is high. Fuel oil There are five commercial grades of fuel oil, also known as bunker fuel oil, or furnace oil, viz. high speed diesel (HSD), light diesel oil (LDO), heavy fuel oil (HFO), furnace oil (FO), low sulfar heavy stock (LSHS). Any oil used for generation of power or heat is identified as fuel oil. It ranges from light diesel oil (LDO) to heavy fuel oil (HFO). LDO is used in burners without preheating, while elaborate heating arrangement is provided to HFO for its use in burners. Equipment used for burning HFO is designed to inhibit formation of carbon deposits. Burners are also provided with an easy removal facility to quickly clean carbon deposits from burner nozzles. 3.6.1.1 Properties As discussed above liquid fuels cover a wide range of products. These products have different uses based on these properties: Specific gravity The specific gravity of a fuel determines the carbon-hydrogen contents of that grade of fuel. For example, a higher specific gravity denotes a higher concentration of carbon than that of hydrogen in that fuel. Eventually the gross calorific value per unit weight of a heavier fuel will be lower than that of a lighter fuel. Knowledge of specific gravityalso helps to convert thevolume of a liquid to its weight. The specific gravity of petroleum liquid is specified as Degree API by the American Petroleum Institute (API) to denote the relative density of petroleum liquid to the density of water at the same temperature. If the API gravity is greater than 10, the fluid is lighter and floats on water; if it is less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. On a hydrometer API gravity is graduated in degrees such that most values will fall between 10 and 70 API gravity degrees, defined as follows: oAPI5ð141:5=GÞ2131:5 ð3:4Þ where G stands for specific gravity of a liquid at 288.5K in relation to water at 288.5K. FuelsandCombustion 105 Viscosity The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to flow. It is the most important property in furnace-oil specification. It influences the degree of pre- heating required for handling, storage, and satisfactory atomization. If the oil is too viscous it may become difficult to pump, the burner may be hard to light, and opera- tion may be erratic. Poor atomization may result in carbon deposits on the burner tips or on the walls. The upper viscosity limit for furnace oil is such that it can be handled without heating in the"

The upper viscosity limit for furnace oil is such that it can be handled without heating in the storage tank except under severe cold conditions. Knowledge of viscosity of a fuel oil also facilitates the design of fuel burners to ensure optimum performance of burners for achieving the highest combustion effi- ciency. Pre-heating may be necessary for proper atomization. For ease of atomization in conventional fuel oil burners the desired maximum viscosity is 25 centistokes. The maximum viscosity for easy pumping of oil in pipes is 1200 centistokes, for which the temperature of the fuel oil should be maintained at around 333(cid:3)343K. The viscosity of fuel oils falls as the temperature rises but becomes nearly constant above about 393K. The density of fuel oils also decreases as the temperature rises, resulting in less weight of oil delivered to the burner. Hence, beyond 393K additional preheating actually lowers the burner capacity. Viscosity of oils is measured conven- tionally as kinematic viscosity and is expressed as stokes, the unit being m2/s, or centistokes. Other standards to denote viscosity include Redwood No. 1, Redwood No. 2, Saybolt Universal, and Engler Degrees. Flash point and fire point The flash point of a flammable liquid is the lowest temperature to which it must be heated to give off sufficient fuel vapor to form an ignitable mixture with air. When a certain quantity of oil is heated slowly and a small flame is passed over the oil surface the temperature at which the first flash occurs is the flash point of that oil sample. At this temperature the vapor may cease to burn when the source of ignition is removed. At a slightly higher temperature, called the fire point, the vapor continues to burn after being ignited. This is the lowest tempera- ture at which the liquid gives off vapor fast enough to support continuous burning even after the ignition flame is removed. Neitherof these parameters is related to tem- peratures of the ignition source, which are much higher. For the same liquid the flash point is lower than the fire point. A flammable liquid with high volatility will have a low flash point, and one having low volatility will have a high flash point. Every flammable liquid has avapor pressure; one with high vapor pressure will have a high flash point, and low vapor pressure denotes a low flash point. Flash points indicate comparatively the degree of safety in storage, transportation, and use of liquid petroleum products, either in closed or open containers."

Flash points indicate comparatively the degree of safety in storage, transportation, and use of liquid petroleum products, either in closed or open containers. They are not directly related to the fire hazards involved. An oil having flash point below 294K (e.g., gasoline) is called a Class “I” petroleum. Flammable liquids with flash points between 294K and 328K (e.g., kerosene) are considered as Class “II” petroleum. 106 ThermalPowerPlant AClass “III” petroleum liquid has a flash point above 328K (e.g., gas oils and fuel oils). The vapor space of a tank or vessel, which contains any of the above three classes of petroleumliquids,isclassifiedasaZone0hazardousarea(discussedinthefollowing). There are two ways to measure flash points: open-cup testers and closed-cup tes- ters. In the open-cup type (e.g., Cleveland Open Cup (COC) and Pensky-Martens Open Cup), the sample is contained in an open cup, which is heated, and at intervals a flame is brought over the surface. The main difference between the two types is that the Cleveland Open Cup is heated from below, while the Pensky-Martens Open Cup is heated both from the sides as well as below. Closed-cup testers are sealed with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced periodically. The oil is heated in the closed cup under specified conditions and a pilot flame is introduced in the vapor space by opening a shutter in the lid. The vapor above the liquid is assumed to be in reasonable equilibrium with the liquid. For oils with flash points above 323K, e.g., fuel oils, gas oils, diesel oils, etc., a Pensky-Martens Closed Cup tester is used, while a Abel Closed Cup tester is used for oils below this temperature, e.g., kerosene. For the same sample, closed-cup testers give lower values for the flash point (typically 5(cid:3)10K lower) than the open-cup tester value. Pour point and cloud point The pour point of oil is the lowest temperature at whichitwillremainstillfluidorcanbepouredunder prescribedconditions.Thistemper- ature is 2.8K higher than the temperature at which oil ceases to flow when cooled.

Carbon residue Fuel oils tend to form carbonaceous deposits when they are burned. The carbon residue value of a fuel gives an approximate indication of the combustibility and deposit-forming tendencies of the fuel. There are two methods for the determination of carbon residue: Conradson’s test and Ramsbottom’s test. Atomizing burners are practically insensitive to the carbon residue of a fuel. Sulfur Crude oils in general contain sulfur in some form or another, which increases with an increase in the boiling range of the oil. Sulfur cannot economically be completely removed, nor is it required to remove it completely. The sulfur content in petroleum products is classified either as corrosive sulfur or total sulfur. FuelsandCombustion 107 Heavy fuel oil may contain 2(cid:3)4% sulfur. On combustion, sulfur releases foul gases, and when it comes across moisture it promotes corrosion. Moisture Moisture in oil is not desirable since it interferes with combustion. Moisture may be present in free or emulsified form and can on combustion cause damage to the inside of furnace surfaces, especially if it contains dissolved salts. It can also cause sputtering of the flame at the burner tip. The water content of furnace oil when supplied is normally very low.

Over time, these pentavanadate 2 5 droplets accumulate and form a hard crust in the interior of the equipment. The thick shield prevents heat transfer that in turn reduces the efficiency of boiler. To mitigate these problems magnesium oxide is introduced, creating a new molecule that will not stick to the interior walls and pipes of boilers and furnaces, allowing better heat transfer thereby increasing combustion efficiency.

In internal combustion (IC) engines vanadium is responsible for forming slag on exhaust valves and seats on 4-cycle engines, and piston crowns on both 2- and 4-cycle engines, causing localized hot spots, which eventually lead to burning away of exhaust valves, seats, and piston crowns. Vanadium can be neutralized during combustion in IC engines by the use of chemical inhibitors (such as magnesium or silicon). Sediment As a blend of residues furnace oil contains some quantity of sediments. These have adverse effect on the burners and cause blockage of filters, etc. However, typical values of sediments are normally much lower than the stipulated value of max- imum 0.25 percent, by mass. Calorific value Calorific value or heat of combustion of a fuel is the amount of heat developed by a fuel when completely burned. Gross calorific value of fuel oils varies within a comparatively narrow range, highest value of 48MJ/kg is for light dis- tillate to the lowest value of 42MJ/kg for heavy fuel oil. Fuel oils are high in 108 ThermalPowerPlant hydrogen content, 11.8(cid:3)14.5%; thus, their net calorific values are less than the respective gross calorific values by as much as 2.60(cid:3)3.18MJ/kg.

Octane number The octane number of a gasoline is a measure of its anti-knock value or its ability to resist knock during combustion in an engine. In spark-ignition internal combustion engines combustion of air/fuel mixture in the cylinder may begin smoothly in response to ignition by the spark plug and then one or more pock- ets of unburned fuel may explode outside the envelope of the normal combustion front. This results in knocking of the engine.

To ensure safety in the application of electri- cal circuit design, instrumentation, and all aspects of power engineering, these areas need to be classified as dangerous or safe. To assess the extent of areas that are hazard- ous, the Institute of Petroleum Electrical Code (IPEC) has defined the following: i. Non-hazardous area: An area in which explosive gas-air mixtures (flammable) are not expected to be present in quantities such as to require special precautions for the construction and use of electrical apparatus. ii. Hazardous area: An area in which explosive gas-air mixtures (flammable) are or may be expected to be present in quantities such as to require special precautions for the construction and use of electrical apparatus. FuelsandCombustion 109 In hazardous areas three types of zones are recognized in order of decreasing prob- abilityof explosive gas-air mixtures (flammable) being present: (cid:129) Zone 0: A zone in which a flammable atmosphere is present continuously, or present for long periods. (cid:129) Zone 1: A zone in which a flammable atmosphere is likely to occur under normal operating conditions. (cid:129) Zone 2: A zone in which a flammable atmosphere is likely to occur under abnormal operating conditions, and, if it does, will onlyexist for a short time. 3.6.2 Gaseous fuels Gaseous fuels may be classified as follows [2]: (cid:129) Fuels naturally found in nature, e.g., natural gas, methane from coal mines, etc. (cid:129) Fuel gases made from solid fuels (cid:129) Gases derived from coal (coal gas) (cid:129) Gases derived from waste and biomass (cid:129) From other industrial processes (blast furnace gas) (cid:129) Gases produced by blowing air and sometimes steam through an incandescent fuel bed (Producer gas) (cid:129) Gases produced in a similar manner to above but allows the production of a higher calorific value fuel by intermittently blasting the incandescent bed with air and steam such that the overall heat balance is maintained (water gas) (cid:129) Gases from other gasification processes, including substitute natural gas (SNG).

If two fuels have identical Wobbe indices then for a given condition the energyoutput will also be identical. The Wobbe Index of natural gas ranges from 35.8(cid:3)71.5MJ/Nm3 and of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from 71.5(cid:3)87.2MJ/Nm3. These two gases are mostly used for steam or power production. Weaver flame speed factor This factor is used to define the probabilityof the gas to react. It is defined as the ratio between the laminar flame speed of a particular gas in relation to the laminar flame speed of hydrogen, which is arbitrarily given a value of 100. The lower the value of this factor the lower the flame speed. The Weaver flame speed factor is greatly influenced by the amount of hydrogen in the mixture. The Weaver factor (We) for gases may be classified into three groups: i. Highflamespeedgases,We532(cid:3)45,havingcalorificvaluebetween17(cid:3)21MJ/Nm3 ii. Intermediate flame speed gases, We525(cid:3)32, having calorific value between 21(cid:3)31MJ/Nm3 iii.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) contains mostly methane, and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) mostly butane and propane. 3.7 PRINCIPLES OF COMBUSTION Combustion is a form of oxidation. When oxygen is combined rapidly with fuels a substantial amount of heat is released. Combustion usually takes place when heat is applied to a fuel from an external source. The potential energy stored in fuels is released by combustion and made available in the form of heat and power. However, nothing burns properly until it becomes a gas. Hence, the degree of flammability of any matter is characterized by how quickly it turns into a gas. In burning this gas it is necessary to have a gas-air mixture that will ignite, after which the temperature of this mixture is raised to its ignition temperature and kept at this condition. The initial stage of fuel burning takes place at a high concentration of the combustible substance and oxidant and an elevated turbulence of the flow, which is formed by the burner. The combustible elements in solid and liquid fuels are carbon, hydrogen, and sul- fur, while combustible components of gaseous fuels are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other unsaturated hydrocarbons as discussed earlier. Chemical reactions that ensure complete combustion of these combustible elements are as follows: Solid and liquid fuels: 1 C1O 5CO ; H 1 O 5H O; S1O 5SO 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Gaseous fuels: 1 1 H 1 O 5H O; CO1 O 5CO ; CH 12O 5CO 12H O; 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 3n11 C n H 2n12 1 O 2 5nCO 2 1ðn11ÞH 2 O 2 112 ThermalPowerPlant These reactions are exothermic, i.e., heat gets released when these chemical reac- tions happen.

From this it may be concluded that combustion is a chemical reaction in which the chemical energy in the combustibles is converted to heat energy. In boiler furnaces, oxygen needed for combustion is supplied by air that contains 23% by weight (21% by volume) of oxygen. The air supplied also contains a large amount of nitrogen, about 77% by weight (about 79% by volume) of nitrogen, which performs no useful action. On the other hand, during the process of combustion this nitrogen combines with oxygen to form NO (NO and NO ) and creates an air- X 2 pollution problem. In addition to oxygen and nitrogen, air also contains a certain amount of humidity that also does not perform any useful function.

The 2 4 amount of oxygen in flue gases indicates a meaningful completeness of combustion pro- cess. Little presence of oxygen in flue gases reveals reasonably correct supplyof excess air and low dry flue-gas heat loss, while a higher value of oxygen will mean higher flue-gas heatloss.Thequantumofexcessairsuppliedforcombustioncanbeeasilyfoundfromthe followingequationprovidedanalysisofflue-gasconstituentgasesareknown: (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:6) CO CO %ExcessAir5100(cid:1) O 2 = 0:264N 2 O 2 ð3:7Þ 2 2 2 2 2 Once analysis of flue-gas constituent gases is done, it is also possible to find out from the following equation, the maximum CO content of flue gas for complete 2 combustion of fuel: 100(cid:1)CO %CO ðmaxÞ5 2 ð3:8Þ 2 10024:76(cid:1)CO 2 The objective of reasonably perfect combustion is to release all of the heat released during the combustion reaction, keeping losses from imperfect combustion and supply of excessive air to a minimum. Once a proper fuel-air ratio is obtained complete combustion of the fuel is assured by three factors, e.g., temperature, turbulence, and time, usually referred to as the 3 Ts [6]. Temperature To initiate combustion, first the combustible elements need to be raised to a specific temperature, known as the ignition temperature of the concerned combustible/s. At this temperature the rate of chemical reaction is sufficiently acceler- ated to produce more heat than is lost to the surroundings so that the combustion process becomes self-sustaining.

To achieve complete combustion, air and fuel must combine in exact proportions commensurate with combustion stoichiometry. The fol- lowing equations delineate the chemical reaction of some common combustible ele- ments, i.e. carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and sulfur (S): C1O 5CO 132:780MJ=kgof C ð3:9Þ 2 2 2H 1O 52H O1141:953MJ=kgof H ð3:10Þ 2 2 2 2 S1O 5SO 19:257MJ=kgof S; ð3:11Þ 2 2 From Eq. 3.9 it may appear that combustion of carbon in the furnace takes place in one step to form CO , but this is not true all the time. In certain cases, combustion 2 of carbon may take place in two steps: first to form CO then further combustion of CO will yield CO [6]. Note that the heat of combustion released in the first step is 2 much smaller than the heat of combustion released in the latter step as is evident from the following reactions: 2C1O (cid:4) 2CO19:227MJ=kgof C; ð3:12Þ 2 2CO1O (cid:4) 2CO 123:553MJ=kgof C; ð3:13Þ 2 2 Before undertaking the above combustion calculations it is important to under- stand the following points: i. For solid and liquid fuels combustibles are expressed as a percentage of elements by weight. 114 ThermalPowerPlant ii. For gaseous fuels combustibles are expressed as a percentage of components by volume or mole (mass of a substance in gm equal to its molecular weight is known as gm-mole or simply mole). iii. In combustion calculations involving gaseous mixtures, it follows from Avogadro’s law that the weights of equal volumes of gases are proportional to their molecular weights, i.e., 1 mole of O 532gm of O 2 2 1mole of H 52gm of H 2 2 1 mole of CH 516gm of CH 4 4 1 mole of CO 544gm of CO 2 2 1 mole of SO 564gm of SO 2 2 iv.

During the process of combustion, substances combine on a molar basis, but theyare usually measured on a mass basis [1]. vi. The amount of air required for stoichiometrically ensuring complete combus- tion of combustibles is called theoretical air. The resulting products of combustion or flue gas are called theoretical products of combustion. Per ASME PTC 4(cid:3)2008, the value of calculated theoretical air for typical fossil fuels should fall within the ranges of theoretical air as follows: Coal (VMdaf .30%) B0.316(cid:3)0.333kg/MJ (735(cid:3)775lbm/MBtu) Oil B 0.316(cid:3)0.324kg/MJ (735(cid:3)755lbm/MBtu) Natural Gas B0.307(cid:3)0.316kg/MJ (715(cid:3)735lbm/MBtu) (Note: VMdaf(cid:3)Volatile matter dry-ash-free basis.) vii. The practical maximum and minimum values of theoretical air for hydrocarbon fuels are denoted as follows: For combustion of carbon theoretical air required: 0.351kg/MJ For combustion of hydrogen theoretical air required: 0.222kg/MJ viii. During the process of actual combustion it is observed that some additional amount of air beyond theoretical air is required to ensure complete combustion of any fuel. This additional air is called “excess air,” [6] or EA, which is expressed as ActualAirSupplied2TheoreticalAir EA;%5100(cid:1) ð3:14Þ TheoreticalAir In a pulverized coal-fired boiler the amount of excess air is usually con- sidered as 20% of theoretical air. While in oil or gas fired boiler excess air is less, e.g., about 15(cid:3)20% for oil and 10(cid:3)15% for gas. ix. Eq. 3.9 reveals that when pure carbon is burned, since CO replaces O in air, 2 2 the percentage of CO in flue gas can never exceed 21% by volume. However, 2 FuelsandCombustion 115 when excess air is supplied this percentage gets reduced, thus 16% by volume of CO in flue gas indicates an efficient combustion system. 2 x. For convenience of calculation, amount of solid and liquid fuels is considered to be 100kg and amount of gaseous fuels and flue gas is 100kmole [1]. xi. In combustion calculations air is considered to be dry and carbon dioxide free. The average molecular weight of such air is 29.0. xii. The volume or mole ratios of components in dry air are as follows [1,7]: Oxygen/Nitrogen50.27 Nitrogen/Oxygen53.76 Oxygen/Air50.21 Air/Oxygen54.76 Nitrogen/Air50.79 Air/Nitrogen51.27 xiii.

Burners do not ignite the fuel [9(cid:3)12]. Their function is to provide thorough and complete mixing of fuel and air, to permit stable ignition and to control flame shape and travel effectively. The primary stage of fuel burning takes place at a high concentration of the combustible substance and oxidant at elevated turbulence of the flow that is formed by the burner. The fuel- air mixture from a burner enters the furnace in the form of straight or swirled jets, 126 ThermalPowerPlant whose progression in the furnace space determines the conditions of ignition and combustion intensity. In a pulverized coal burner, onlya part of the air, called the “primaryair,” is initially mixed with fuel to obtain rapid ignition. The remaining air, called “secondary air,” is introducedoutsidetheprimary-air ports.Primaryair isusually20(cid:3)30%ofthetotalair. (Pulverized coal burners are discussed in Chapter 4, Pulverized Coal-Fired Boiler.) In the fuel oil burner, oil is atomized either utilizing fuel pressure or with the help of compressed air or steam. The former type is called the mechanical type or pressure type atomized burners. They use 1.5(cid:3)2.0MPa oil pressure at maximum flow. Here a high velocity swirl is imparted to oil, which is released through the orifice in the form of a conical mist. Regulation of burner output is done by varying the supply oil pressure, but since the pressure determines efficiency of atomization, there is not much of range for regulating the burner output. Therefore, the turn-down ratio (operating range) of these burners is generally low, e.g., 2:1 to 4:1. Redwood No.1 viscosityof oil"

The limitation of the turn-down ratio of the pressure-atomized burner is largely overcome by air- or steam-atomized burner. Burner output in air or steam atomized burners may be varied by varying the oil pressure and air/steam pressure correspond- ingly. Air/steam is fed into a central tube (Figure 3.1) at a pressure of 0.5(cid:3)1.2MPa to Oil Steam Oil Inner Distributor Capnut barrel head Outer Sprayer plate barrel Resistor plate Figure3.1 Fueloilburner. FuelsandCombustion 127 a perforated plate where it meets the oil, which has passed along an annular space between the central air/steam tube and the concentric outer tube. This burner produces a fine spray and for this reason it may be used to light a burner in a cold furnace. The turn-down ratio of an atomized oil burner is as high as 10:1 and requires a maximum oil pressure of about 0.7MPa. The details of a typical oil-burner connection are shown in Figure 3.2. Gas burners use either a perforated ring or a gun to admit fuel to the burner. Cleaning these burners is generally simple. Depending on the type of fuel, amount of volatile matter, etc., burners may be the turbulent or vortex type and straight-flow type [12]. In a turbulent burner, the fuel- air mixture and secondary air are fed as swirled jets. They are widely used for low- volatile fuels. In a straight-flow burner, the fuel-air mixture and secondary air are sup- plied as parallel jets. These burners are employed with high-volatile coals, brown coals, peat, oil-shale, etc. Arrangement of Burners: Burners may be arranged in one or more tiers based on the heat requirement for the desired steam generating capacity. A typical arrange- ment of turbulent pulverized-coal burners are the front wall, opposed (front and rear) wall, and opposed side wall. A corner or tangential arrangement is used for straight- flow burners. In this arrangement flame jets are directed tangentially to an imaginary circle in the furnace center that ensures complete combustion.

For horizontal turbulent burners, the oil burner is concentric to the coal burner. In a horizontal lignite-fired boiler the oil burner is located in the side walls. While in a tangential corner-fired boiler the oil burner is located between two tiers/elevations of the coal burner. In addition to these burners, other burners may be placed in the furnace in the following configurations: Horizontal Burner: This burner has a central coal nozzle with internal ribs in the form of rifling. A central pipe allows insertion of ignition torch. The nozzle of this burner is surrounded with a housing that is provided with adjustable vanes for con- trolling air turbulence as well as flame shape. Circular Register Burner: Gas, oil, or pulverized coal or any combination of these fuels can be burned in this burner. However, combination of oil and pulverized coal is sel- dom recommended, since coal may form coke, thus reducing burner performance. IntervaneBurner:Vanes contribute a swirling actionto the coal-air mixture in a cen- tralnozzle.Thus,considerableturbulenceresults,whichensuresefficientcombustion. Directional Burner: In this burner air and fuel are introduced through vertical open- ings between tubes of furnace walls. Each opening has directional vanes that can be adjusted to obtain optimum placement of fuel for efficient combustion. Fuel is generally fired in burners in anyone of the following basic configurations: a. Horizontal Firing(cid:3)through fixed burners from one wall or opposed wall b. Vertical or Down-shot Firing(cid:3)with single-U or double-U flame shape c. Tangential or Corner Firing(cid:3)usually with tilting tip burner assembly for steam temperature control 3.9.1 Horizontal firing (Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4) For medium and high volatile coal horizontal firing using short flame turbulent type burners is suitable. Burners may be arranged in the front wall, front and rear wall, or on both sidewalls based on convenience of design and layout. This type of burner can accommodate any type of fuel, e.g., gas, oil, and pulverized fuel. By virtue of their construction a composite burner burning any combination of the above fuels is also easily accomplished. Each one of this type of burner produces a short, turbulent, stable flame around itself, and the combustion is more or less com- plete within its burning zone. This feature makes each burner self-sufficient, and adja- cent burners have only a slight effect on its performance. A certain amount of regulation permits flame length adjustment by secondary air, impeller position, etc., but care is needed to ensure that the point of ignition is not shifted too far"

Low volatile coal takes longer to complete combustion and does not require high turbulence as in horizontal firing. The coal and primary air is fed vertically downward from the burners near one side of the furnace roof. The gas outlet is through another side of the roof and it follows a U-shaped path. Secondary air may be introduced either through rows of ports on the sidewall adjacent to the burners or concentrically with primary air jets. A down-shot furnace may also be fired from opposite ends of the furnace roof, the gas outlet being at the center that results in W-shaped flame. Coal and secondary air are injected in narrow parallel streams and get mixed thoroughly during their downward travel. About 40% of total combustion air, i.e., primary and secondary, is provided at the burners, and remaining 60% are provided progressively at right angles to the flame path, through the wall. By progressive addition of combustion air a controlled amount of turbulence is created to ensure complete combustion and products of combustion finally pass upwards through the furnace.

Admission of fuel and air into the furnace is through four windbox (airbox) assemblies located in four corners of the furnace. The fuel and air streams from the windbox nozzles are directed to an imaginary firing circle in the furnace center. The swirling action of this type of firing is most effective in turbulent mixing of the burning fuel in a constantly changing air and gas atmosphere. This burner system has the advantage of a single-flame envelope for burning wide range of fuels. Fuel streams are injected into the furnace between air streams. Burners are arranged vertically and the fuel is normally fired on a level basis (Figure 3.7) so that proper interaction of the separate streams is obtained. Even if one corner is blanked off entirely, combustion can be stable and efficient. 3.10 FLAME STABILITY A"

Even if one corner is blanked off entirely, combustion can be stable and efficient. 3.10 FLAME STABILITY A burner sustains a stable flame when the flame front close to the burner experiences no backlash or blow-off of flame under various operating conditions. The rate of flame propagation or flame velocity is of paramount importance in determining flame stability. When the flame velocity balances the velocity of the fuel-air mixture at the flame front the flame is said to be stable [12]. Changes in fuel composition and the ratio of fuel-air mixture along with its temperature have considerable effect on flame stability. The inside diameter of the burner also greatly affects the flame stability. Too high a diameter will cause burner backlash while too low a diameter will result in burner blow-off. xobdniW xobdniW FuelsandCombustion 131 Secondary air damper Ignitor Figure3.6 Tangentialfiring. 132 ThermalPowerPlant air box GG FF F OG EF E DE D OG CD C BC LOG B OG AB A AA Figure3.7 Typicalcornerfiredburners.

Modern, large-capacity steam-generating units employ membrane/finned tube waterwalls for furnace enclosure with an external layer of insulation. These watercooled furnaces are designed to comply with the following requirements: 1. Sufficient height in a drum type steam generator to ensure adequate fluid circula- tion in the furnace tubes 2. Sufficient surface area such that the furnace gas temperature can be reduced to an acceptable level of superheating requirement; the furnace exit gas temperature should be slightly lower than the ash fusion temperature 3. Sufficient furnace depth to obviate flame impingement on opposite wall 4. Sufficient furnace width to accommodate all burners on acceptable pitching to avoid interference of flames and impingement on side-walls FuelsandCombustion 133 5. Sufficient overall dimension and shape to ensure a gas path that will “fill” the fur- nace and provide optimum heat absorption to all parts 6. A fuel ash residence time sufficient enough to burn-out and at the same time to restrict furnace gas temperature to remain below the ash melting state 7.

Mir Publishers, Moscow; 1985. CHAPTER 4 Pulverized Coal-Fired Boilers 4.1 BRIEF HISTORY Steam-operated central power stations started operating in the late nineteenth century (1881(cid:1)1900). Within a couple of decades suspension firing of pulverized coal (finely ground coal particles) was in use at the Oneida Street Power Station, owned by Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, for the first time in a utility [1]. The concept of suspension firing evolved from the belief that if coal were ground to the fineness of flour, it would flow through coal pipes like oil [2] and would burn in the furnace space as easily and efficiently as gas. By the 1920s, pulverized coal firing became so developed that it resulted in more complete coal combustion and higher system efficiencies. As a result, pulverized coal firing also became attractive to larger boilers. However, it took nearly 5 years for pul- verized coal firing to become a dependable method of coal firing for commercial pro- duction and utilization of steam. By the 1950s, pulverized coal firing was the main method of coal firing, leading to the construction of large, efficient, and reliable steam generators and power plants. In pulverized coal firing, fine particles of coal are easily moved by the flowof air and products of combustion through parts of the furnace. Combustion takes place in the fur- nacespacewithinaveryshorttime(1(cid:1)2s)ofthepresenceofparticlesinthefurnace[3].

Efficient combustion of pulverized coal depends on following characteristics of coal [4]: i. Grinding and abrasion properties ii. Volatile matter yield iii. Ignitability and flame stability iv.

Fouling and slagging due to the presence of ash vi. SO and NO emission X X As mentioned, when coal is ground to the fineness of flour, the ground coal will flow in pipes like oil and burn in furnace like gas. To arrive at such fineness, it is essential to dry and pulverize the coal using special equipment. Thereafter, other equipment is provided for transporting this dry and pulverized coal to the furnace in an air stream. In addition, another set of equipment is required for injecting this coal along with the air needed for combustion to the furnace. When combined with air in a furnace, pulverized coal first passes through the stage of thermal preparation, which consists of the evaporation of residual moisture and separation of volatiles. Once these minute particles enter the furnace at a temperature of 1200(cid:1)1500K (depending on the type of fuel) and are exposed to heat, their temperature rises and the volatile matter distills off within a fraction of a second. To facilitate transport of pulverized coal, adequate quantityof primary air (20(cid:1)30% of total combustion air) is introduced at the burner to dry and carry the pulverized coal from pulverizers to the burner or the bin. This air intimately mixes with the stream of coal particles to burn gas resulting from distillation of each particle in the stream [2]. Fuelparticlesareheatedto atemperature673(cid:1)873K atwhichvolatilesareevolved intensively in a few tenths of a second. Volatile matter, mostly hydrocarbons, ignites more easily than the carbon components of the coal, and heating the latter produces coke.Theintensiveburningofthevolatilestakes0.2(cid:1)0.5s[3].Ahighyieldofvolatiles produces enough heat through combustion to ignite coke particles. When the yield of volatilesislow,thecokeparticlesmustbeheatedadditionallyfromanexternalsource. The final stage is the combustion of coke particles at a temperature above 1073(cid:1)1273K. This is a heterogeneous process whose rate is determined by oxygen supply to the reacting surface. Secondary air (70(cid:1)80% of total combustion air), intro- duced around the burner, sweeps past and scrubs the hot carbon particles and gradu- ally burns them. The burning of a coke particle takes up the greater portion of the total time of combustion, which may be of the order of 1.0(cid:1)2.0s, depending on the kind of fuel and the initial size of particles.

Complete burnout of pulverized coal particles depends on physical and chemical properties of the resultant char, individual boiler design, and boiler operating conditions. NO production from a pulverized coal-fired boiler is X dependent on coal characteristics, boiler and burner design, and operating conditions. During combustion of coal particles the reacting mechanism between carbon and oxygen takes place in two stages. Oxygen is adsorbed on the surface of particles and reacts chemically with carbon to form CO. Carbon monoxide then reacts with oxygen within the boundary gas film to get oxidized to CO [1]. 2 (The principle of combustion is discussed in Chapter 3, Fuels and Combustion.) 4.3 PULVERIZER PERFORMANCE The factors that affect pulverizer-grinding performance along with its processing capacity are discussed as follows. Raw-Coal Size: Normally plants receive run-of-mine coal, although in certain plants washed coal is also supplied. While using run-of-mine coal, it is important to make feed size as uniform as possible, since pulverizer performance is strongly influ- enced by raw coal size. The smaller the size the better the performance. For small mills top size usually falls between 15 and 25mm. For medium and large mills, the desired top size of coal may be up to 30mm and 55mm, respectively. However, for a particular type of mill, the size of the coal to be used as mill input should conform to the coal size recommended by the manufacturer. Fineness: Fineness of pulverized coal is extremely important in system design. The higher the fineness of pulverized coal, the lower the pulverizer processing capacity (Figure4.1). Thedegreeoffinenessofpulverizedcoaldependstoalargeextentoncoalcharacter- istics.Thedesiredfinenessisalsodeterminedbythewayitaffectsthecoalcombustionin the furnace.

Forcaking coals, pulverization should produce sufficiently fine coal particles to prevent lightweight porous coke particles from floating out of the furnace before completing effective combustion. Free-burning coal, however, does not requirethesamedegreeoffineness[2]. To burn pulverized coal successfully in a furnace, the following two requirements must be met: a.

Volatile Matter: It is known that high-volatile coal ignite more readily than low- volatile coal. Hence, high-volatile coal requires less pulverization than low-volatile coal. Contrary to this, low-volatile coal, except for anthracite, has higher grindability, because it is softer [2]. As a result, the balance between these two characteristics deter- mines the pulverizer output. In practice, with volatile content above 22%, the fineness can be kept between 65 and 70% passing through 200 mesh to ensure ignition stabil- ity; while with less than 18% volatile matter content the fineness has to be increased to 80% or above through 200 mesh. Grindability: This term is used to measure the ease of pulverizing a coal. Unlike moisture, ash, or heating value, this index is not an inherent property of coal [7]. Grindability should not be considered as synonymous with the hardness of coal [7]. Anthraciteisaveryhardcoal,whereasligniteissoft;however,botharedifficulttogrind. The hardness of coal is generally in the range 10(cid:1)70kg/mm2, depending on rank, with a minimum near 20% volatile matter. Its index is generally given as the Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI). The higher the index of coal the softer it is to pulverize. It is generally considered that for a desired coal fineness and selected feed size, the mill capacity has a direct relationship with grindability; however, this capacity is significantly influenced by the moisture content of the coal as is evident from Figure 4.2 [8]. If the coal-drying operation is inadequate, the mill capacity is dictated by moisture content and not by grinding. Thus, more output may be available from a mill with a dry coal of lower grindability than with a wet coal of higher grindability. From the above discussion it is easy to argue that to maintain the same steam- generating capacity, if the moisture content of coal, coal fineness, and feed size remain unchanged, the higher the HGI value, the lower the required pulverizer output. Thus, a higher correction factor should be applied to arrive at correct pulverizer 1.7 60% output (Figure 4.3). Reason being pulverizer design capacity is guaranteed under specified HGI value. Deviation from this value will cause a change in design capacity. Hence for deviations from specified HGI value, it is necessary to correct the measured capacity using the correction factor to get the design capacityof the pulverizer. Moisture: As discussed above the moisture content of coal significantly influences pulverizer performance. It is the surface moisture (SM) that affects pulverization the most; inherent moisture (IM) has little or no effect. If the"

Agglomeration of fines has the same effect as coarse coal during the combustion process. Hence, during the process of pulverization coal must be dried enough to make it free of surface moisture [1]. Hot air is normally supplied for drying of coal inside the pulverizer. If the surface moisture is excessive, the pulverizer must be capable of handling large volumes of high-temperature air. In the event that there is deficiency of hot air or if the pulver- izer is unable to handle additional hot air, transport of the pulverized coal to the bur- ners will be reduced. Figure 4.4 shows the relationship between the weight of the air per unit of fuel and the temperature of the coal-air mixture leaving the pulverizer with varying surface moisture for a particular coal. For high-volatile coal to prevent pre-ignition of dry coal inside the pulverizer, the coal-air mixture temperature at the pulverizer outlet has to be maintained at around 338(cid:1)348K, while for low-volatile coal this temperature may be safely raised to 355(cid:1)373K. Thus, the supplied air may be pre-heated to a temperature of 600K or above, as recommended by the manufacturer. GCV(HHV)ofCoal:The heatingvalueofcoal alsoinfluences the pulverizerout- put.

High quartz content in ash would exacerbate the wearing characteristics of grinding parts but not mill capacity. The larger the size of these parti- cles, the longer they remain in circulation in the mill, hence wear rates are increased. Quartz, with a density of approximately twice that of coal, has to be ground to a finer size when compared to the coal particles before it is released out of the pulverizer by the primary air. Rounded quartz particles cause higher wear than that resulting from angular particles. Quartz causes a three- to four-fold increase in abrasion over siderite (amineral composedofFeCO ),whichinturnisaboutthreetimesmoreabrasivethan 3 calcite(acarbonatemineralandthemoststablepolymorphofCaCO ). 3 The wear life of the pulverizer-grinding components is adversely affected by the presence of rock and stones (typical Moh’s scale of hardness 6), which cause five times the wear caused by coal (typical Moh’s scale of hardness 3). Hence, a lower correction factor should be applied to arrive at correct pulverizer output for a coal containing a higher quantityof extraneous materials as presented in Figure 4.7. Pulverizers also suffer from chemical wear, i.e., corrosion, in a moist atmosphere. Sulphur (oxidized pyrite) and chlorine (chloride and sodium ion) compounds and organic acids are comprised of an acidic and corrosive medium in moist coal. Furthermore, moisture in the absence of acids can enhance abrasion wear. 4.4 COAL BURNERS (FIGURE 4.8) After pulverization, coal is transported pneumatically to the burners through pipes.

The air that transports coal to the burner is called the primary air, while secondary air is introduced around or near the burner. The burners impart a rotary motion to the coal-air mixture in a central zone, and the secondary air around the nozzle (cid:1) all within the burner. The rotary motion provides pre-mixing for the coal and air along with some turbulence.

(Detailed treatmentonthedesignaspectsofburnersisgiveninChapter3,FuelsandCombustion.) 148 ThermalPowerPlant 4.5 PULVERIZER SYSTEM DESIGN NFPA 85 recommends the pulverizer system arrangement should be such as to pro- vide only one direction of flow, i.e., from the points of entrance of fuel and air to the points of discharge. The system should be designed to resist the passage of air and gas from the pulverizer through the coal feeder into the coal bunker. To withstand pulverizer-operating pressures and to resist percolation of hot air/gas, a vertical or cylindrical column of fuel at least the size of three coal-pipe diameters should be pro- vided between the coal-bunker outlet and the coal-feeder inlet as well as between coal-feeder outlet and the pulverizer inlet. Within these cylindrical columns there will be accumulation of coal that will resist percolation of hot air/gas from the pulverizer to the coal bunker. All components of the pulverized coal system should be designed towithstand an internal explosion gauge pressure of 344kPa [9]. Besides the above, design specifications of a pulverizer system must also consider the following: Number of Spare Pulverizers: To overcome forced outage and consequent availability of a number of operating pulverizers it is generally considered that while firing the worst coal one spare pulverizer should"

Besides the above, design specifications of a pulverizer system must also consider the following: Number of Spare Pulverizers: To overcome forced outage and consequent availability of a number of operating pulverizers it is generally considered that while firing the worst coal one spare pulverizer should be provided under the TMCR (Turbine Maximum Continuous Rating) operating condition. In certain utilities one spare pulverizer is also provided even while firing design coal, but under the BMCR (Boiler Maximum Continuous Rating) operating condition. Practice followed in the United States generally is to provide one spare pulverizer for firing design coal, in larger units two spare pulverizers are provided. However, provision of any spare pul- verizer is not considered in current European design [5]. PulverizerDesign Coal:The pulverizer system should bedesigned to accommo- date the fuel with the worst combination of properties that will still allow the steam generator to achieve the design steam flow. Three fuel properties that affect pulverizer- processingcapacityaremoisture,heatingvalue,andHGI,asdiscussedearlier. Pulverizer Product Fineness: Fineness of pulverized fuel is one of the pulver- izer sizing criteria, as discussed earlier. Unit Turndown: The design of a pulverizer system determines the turndown capability of the steam generator. The minimum stable load for an individual pulver- izer firing coal is 50% of the rated pulverizer capacity. Normally in utility boilers, the operating procedure is to operate at least two pulverizers to sustain a self-supported minimum boiler load. Thus, the minimum steam generator load when firing coal without supporting fuel is equal to the full capacity of one pulverizer. Therefore, a loss of one of the two running pulverizers will not trip the steam generator because of “loss of fuel” and/or “loss of flame.” Pulverizer Wear Allowance: A final factor affecting pulverizer system design is a “capacity margin” that would compensate for loss of grinding capacity as a result of wear between overhauls of the pulverizer (Figure 4.6). A typical pulverizer-sizing cri- terion is 10% capacity loss due towear. PulverizedCoal-FiredBoilers 149 4.6 CLASSIFICATION OF PULVERIZERS A pulverizer, also known as a grinding mill, is the main equipment associated with a pulverized coal-fired boiler. Grinding inside a pulverizer is realized by impact, attri- tion, crushing, or a combination of these. Based on their operating speed, pulverizers/ mills are classified as “low,” “medium,” and “high” speed mills [10]. Depending on the pressure existing inside the grinding zone, pulverizers may be categorized as the suction type or the pressurized type. For both types, the pulverizing of coal is accom- plished in the following two stages: Feeding System: This system must automatically control fuel-feed rate according to the boiler-load demand and the air rates required for drying and transporting pulver- ized coal to the burner.

Drying: One important property of coal being prepared for pulverization is that it has to be dry and dusty. 4.6.1 Low-speed mill Mills operating below 75rpm are known as low-speed mills.

Primary air is circulated over the charge to carry the pulverized coal to classifiers. In this type of mill pulverized coal exits from the same side of the mill that solid coal and air enter. In some designs entry of solid coal air and exit of pulverized coal are provided at each end of the mill. Both ends of the mill are symmetrical in nature. Consequently, each mill is served by two coal feeders. Reliability of this type of mill is very high and it requires low maintenance. The disadvantages of this type of mill are high power consumption, larger and heavier con- struction, greater space requirement, etc. To pulverize coal of high rank and low grindability, ball/tube mills are preferred because they can achieve high fineness, required for proper burning, and maintain high availability. 4.6.2 Medium-speed mill This type of pulverizer is usually one of two types: ball and race and roll and race. The speed of the grinding section of these mills is usually between 75 and 225rpm. Medium-speed mills are smaller than low-speed units and are generally the vertical spindle type. They operate on the principles of crushing and attrition. Pulverization takes place between two surfaces, one rolling on top of the other. The rolling ele- ments may be balls or rolls that roll between two races, in the manner of a ball bear- ing.

Configuration of vertical spindle mills may be either the pressurized type with a cold/ hot primary air fan or the exhauster type. Medium-speed mills require medium to high maintenance, but their power consumption is low. Ball and Race Mill (Figure 4.10): In the ball-and-race mill, balls are held between two races, much like a large ball bearing. The top race or grinding ring remains stationary while the bottom race rotates. As the coal is ground between large diameter balls and the ring, the balls are free to rotate on all axes and there- fore remain spherical. Grinding pressure is adjusted by controlling the tension of springs. Roll and Race Mill: The grinding elements of this type of mill consist of three equally spaced, spring-loaded heavy conical (Figure 4.11) or toroidal rolls (Figure 4.12), which, suitably suspended inside near the periphery, travel in a concave grinding ring or bowl (with heavy armoring). Force is applied to the rolls from above by a uniformly loaded thrust ring. The main drive shaft turns the table supporting the grinding ring, which in turn transmits the motion to the rollers.

These mills are either hammer beater or attrition mills, which operate at speeds above 225rpm. The beaters revolve in a chamber equipped with high-wear-resistant liners. Both impact and attrition is combined in this mill to pulverize coal, which is pulverized by the rub- bing of coal on coal, by the impact of coal on impeller clips, and also by being rubbed between pegs.

Its maintenance cost, however, is very high, which is the reason this type of mill has long been discontinued from service.

The stored coal from the pulverized coal bunker is fed to the burners through the respective pulverizedcoalfeedersandconveyedbyprimaryair.Additionalvapor burners are provided in this system to burn the escaping coal dust (2(cid:1)3%) after the cyclone separators.Thebasicadvantageofthissystemisthatthepulverizationisnottiedupwith the minute-to-minute operations of the boiler and the system can withstand the outage of the pulverizer to a certain extent, depending upon the storage capacity available. The disadvantagesareintrinsicdustnuisanceofinstallation,fireriskofpulverizedcoalstorage, highercostofpulverization,etc.Itisessentialtoincorporateanadditionalfire-prevention systemanddust-coaldisposalsystemtopreventunforeseenboileroutages. The bin system was widely used before pulverizing equipment reached the stage where it was reliable enough for continuous steadyoperation. For successful operation, the following guidelines need to be adhered to: i. Surface moisture in the pulverized coal must not exceed 3%. ii. Fineness should not be less than 90% through a 50-mesh sieve. Because of the many stages of drying, storing, transporting, etc., the bin system is subject to fire hazards from spontaneous combustion. Nevertheless, it is still in use in manyolder plants. PulverizedCoal-FiredBoilers 155 4.7.2 Direct Firing System (Figure 4.15) The bin system has been overshadowed by the direct-firing system because of greater simplicity, lower initial investment, lower operating costs, less space requirement, and greater plant cleanliness. The pulverizing equipment developed for direct-firing systems permits continuous utilization of raw coal directly from the bunkers through a feeder, pulverizer, and primary-air fan, to the furnace burners. There are two direct-firing methods in use (cid:1) the pressure type, where the primary-air fan is located at the pulverizer inlet, and the suction type, where the primary-air fan is located downstream the pulverizer. In either type, the coal is delivered to the burners with air as the transport medium.

Greater plant cleanliness The only disadvantage of this system is any outage in the pulverizer system imme- diately affects unit output, even though spare pulverizers are usually provided. Fuel feed is regulated to load demand by a combination of controls on the feeder and the primary-air fan to give fuel-air ratios in accordance with variations in steam genera- tion. Large steam generators are provided with more than one pulverizer system, each feeding a number of burners, so that a wide control range is possible by varying the number of pulverizers and the load on each. 4.8 COAL FEEDERS Coal from the raw-coal bunker is fed to the pulverizer through a raw-coal feeder or simplythecoalfeeder.Thefunctionof acoalfeeder istocontroltheflowofcoaltothe pulverizer to comply with the demand of steam generation. In general, there are vari- ous kinds of raw-coal feeders inuse, e.g., tabletype, overshot roll type, belt type, drag- link type, etc. Coal flows from raw coal bunker on to a moving belt through a vertical pipe,andfromthisbeltcoalflowstoapulverizerthroughanotherverticalpipe.

The first installation of gravimetric feeder was placed in continuous oper- ation at Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation’s Dunkirk Station in 1957 [11]. The benefits of gravimetric feeding are: i. Exact and constant amount of coal feed to the mill ii. Saving of coal due to exact control of excess air iii. Fast and stable boiler load changes iv. Accurate energy accounting Two different types of gravimetric coal feeder generally used in the industry are s the Stock gravimetric feeder and the Pfister rotor weighfeeder. The Stock gravimet- ric coal feeder weighs material on a length of belt between two fixed rollers (span) precisely located in the feeder body. A third roller, located midway in the span and supported at each end by precision load cells, supports half the weight on the span. As material passes over the span, the load cell generates an electrical signal directly pro- portional to the weight supported by the center roller. The Pfister rotor weighfeeder works like a horizontal star feeder. The gravimetric coal mass in the feeder is measured by a load cell. The speed of the feeder motor is controlled inverse to the coal content in the feeder. Less coal in the feeder results in higher speed, and more coal in the feeder results in lower speed. The outcome is a highly accurate feed rate at the outlet. BIBLIOGRAPHY [1] Stultz SC, Kitto JB, editors. STeam Its Generation and Use, 39th/41st ed. The Babcock And WilcoxCompany;1978/2005.

CHAPTER 5 Fluidized-Bed Combustion Boilers 5.1 BRIEF HISTORY Fluidized-bed technology was initiated in the 1920s as a process for refining petro- leum and for the production of chemical feedstock from coal. This technology has been applied for the following since the 1940s: i. Calcination of Alumina ii. Cracking of Hydrocarbon iii. Roasting of Ore iv. Incineration of Wastes However, fluidized-bed technology as an alternative method for combustion of coal gained popularity in the 1950s when researchers started looking for ways to reduce atmospheric pollutants such as SO and NO [1]. During the second half of the 1980s, 2 X fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) rapidly emerged as a viable option for stoker-fired and pulverized coal-fired units for the combustion of solid fuels due to following: i. Rise in cost of conventional fuel and demand for multi-fuel firing ii. Fuel flexibility iii. Stringent SO and NO emission regulation 2 X iv. Availabilityof only low-grade coal for firing in boilers in some countries v. High combustion efficiency vi. Low combustion temperature vii. High heat and mass transfer viii. Low time of reaction ix. Less capital investment compared to that required to install pulverized coal-fired boiler x. Less operating costs leading to more profits xi. Reduced auxiliary power consumption The use of bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) technology in the electric utility industry in the United States began in 1976 [2]. The first application of circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) technology in the United States occurred in 1981 and became operational by 1988. In Germany, although development of CFB combustors began in 1955, the CFB technology was first applied to the combustion of coal in 1982 when a co-generation ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

Combustion takes place in the bed with high heat transfer to the furnace and low combustion temperatures. The fluidized-bed process is shown schematically in Figures 5.1 through 5.10. When at rest the fluidized bed resembles a uniformly distributed bed of solid particles, e.g., sand Fluidized-BedCombustionBoilers 161 stacked on a perforated plate of fine mesh at an intermediate position of an enclosed vessel (Figure 5.1). The perforated plate facilitates uniform distribution of fluid (air or gas) flow through the bed. At the bottom of the plate pressurized fluid is supplied. When this pressurized fluid is allowed to pass upward through the bed of solid par- ticles the bed tends to offer resistance to low fluid velocities such that the particles remain in contact and stay stagnant. This bed is called a fixed bed (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3). With an increase in fluid velocity the particles offer less resistance and tend to expand. With further increase in fluid velocity a situation occurs in which particles are unable to remain in contact and start separating, resulting in bubble formation, vigorous turbulence, and rapid mixing. The motion of bubbles in this bed resembles the motion of bubbles in a liquid, and the bed of solid particles looks similar in Sand Air plenum Distributor plate Figure 5.1 Bed at rest. Source: P17-1.

This is called a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB), which is shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7. The volume occupied by the fluid- solid mixture increases substantially. For this case, there is an easily seen bed level and a distinct transition between the bed and space above. By increasing the fluid flow further, the bubbles become larger and begin to coa- lesce, forming large voids in the bed. The solids are present as interconnected groups Air bubbing bed Figure5.6 Bubblingfluidizedbed. Fluidized-BedCombustionBoilers 165 Air bubbling Figure5.7 Bubblingfluidizedbed. Air Turbulent Figure5.8 Turbulentfluidizedbed. of high solids concentration. This condition is called a turbulent fluidized bed (Figure 5.8). If the solids are caught, separated from the fluid, and returned to the bed they will circulate around a loop [7]. This type of system is called a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) and is shown in Figures 5.9 and 5.10. Unlike the bubbling bed, there is no dis- tinct transition between the dense bed in the bottom of the container and the dilute zone above. The solids concentration gradually decreases between these two zones. A commercial fluidized bed is comprised of sand, limestone, or sorbent, refractory, or ash along with only 3(cid:1)5% coal. Above the fluidized bed there is provision for 166 ThermalPowerPlant Air circulating sec Figure5.9 Circulatingfluidizedbed. Gas Air circulating Figure5.10 Circulatingfluidizedbed. sufficient free-board height to prevent excessive elutriation of bed material or unburned carbon at the operating fluidizing velocity. The main feature of a fluidized bed is that throughout the combustor a homogeneous temperature is maintained at around 1073(cid:1)1223K. Thus, sintering of the bed is avoided, which takes place once the temperature exceeds 1223K while burning coal. The above temperature range also suggests that combustion should take place at a minimum temperature of 1073K below which combustion efficiency declines. In most fluidized-bed boilers a low excess air level is achieved by providing an in-bed tube bundle designed to extract the heat released in excess of the heat removed Fluidized-BedCombustionBoilers 167 by the gas. The majority of the heat in the gas is recovered in convective heat transfer surfaces.

It is the temperature of the solids that dominates the bed thermal behavior because of its high heat capacity, and it is the gas temperature that follows temperature of the particles. Fuel flexibility and reduced emissions are the benefits utilities can gain by adopting FBC. FBC is appropriate for firing a variety of solid fuels, e.g., coal, petro-coke, bio- mass, wood, coal washery rejects, etc., with varying heating value, ash content, and moisture content in the same unit. The calorific value can be as low as 7.5MJ/kg. In FBC, pollutants in products of combustion are reduced concurrently with combustion (cid:1) much of the ash and hence theparticulate matter is removedduring the combustionprocess,including sulfur.In addition, FBCoccursat muchlower tempera- tures than the combustion temperatures of 1573(cid:1)1773K required in pulverized coal- fired boilers, thus resulting in lower production of NO . This reduced combustion X temperature also helps avoid slagging problemswith inferiorgradesof coal. The result- ing ash of this boiler is less erosive in nature. Oil support requires a much lower load, about25%,thanthatrequiredinpulverizedcoal-firedboiler,whichisabout40%. The residues from FBC consist of mineral matter content of the as-fired fuel, as well as residual sorbent, i.e., CaO/MgO/CaSO /CaCO . High free lime may also be 4 3 present in the residues. As a result strongly alkaline matter will leach from the bed. 5.3 CATEGORIES OF FBC Therearetwobasiccategoriesof FBC:atmosphericfluidized-bedcombustion(AFBC) and pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC). NFPA 85 defines AFBC as “a fuel- firingtechniqueusingfluidizing-bedoperatingatnear-atmosphericpressureonthefire side” [9]. The AFBC option is further comprised of two types: bubbling fluidized-bed combustion (BFBC) and CFBC. In AFBC, steam is generated for power production usingtheconventionalRankinecycle. A fluidizing bed in which the fluidizing velocity exceeds the terminal velocity of individual bed particles and in which part of the fluidizing gas passes through the bed as bubbles is called a bubbling fluidized bed. In a circulating fluidized bed the fluidizing velocities substantially exceed the terminal velocity of the individual bed particles where the bed and the free board above the bed cannot be distinguished and become a uniform fluidized bed. PFBC units operate at 1.0(cid:1)1.5MPa pressure and offer the potential of smaller boilers in comparison with AFBC [10]. In a PFBC boiler, the combustion gas tem- perature at the exit of the boiler is in the range of 1088(cid:1)1143K, which is further 168 ThermalPowerPlant used to drive a gas turbine. PFBC boilers are normally used in combined cycle units [11]. Combustion efficiency of PFBC is better"

In a PFBC boiler, the combustion gas tem- perature at the exit of the boiler is in the range of 1088(cid:1)1143K, which is further 168 ThermalPowerPlant used to drive a gas turbine. PFBC boilers are normally used in combined cycle units [11]. Combustion efficiency of PFBC is better than that of AFBC. As with AFBC, two configurations, i.e., bubbling bed and circulating bed, are also possible in PFBC. Out of above four configurations of FBCs, atmospheric CFBC finds the widest application globally. 5.3.1 Advantages The advantages of FBC boilers over conventional boilers are: i. Combustion efficiency of FBC is comparable to that of conventional boilers because of effective contact among heated bed material, gas, and solid fuel even though the bed temperature is low. ii. An environmentally attractive feature of FBC is that sulfur dioxide (SO ) can be 2 removed in the combustion process by adding sorbent (e.g., slaked lime (CaO) or limestone (CaCO ) or dolomite (CaCO (cid:4)MgCO )) to the fluidized bed, elimi- 3 3 3 nating the need for an external scrubber or flue gas desulfurization (FGD) plant. The sorbent, in combination with oxygen from the supplied air, absorbs sulfur dioxide according to the following reactions: 1 CaO1SO 1 O 12H O5CaSO U2H O ð5:6Þ 2 2 2 4 2 2 1 CaCO 1SO 1 O 12H O5CaSO U2H O1CO ð5:7Þ 3 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 1 CaCO UMgCO 1SO 1 O 5CaSO UMgO12CO ð5:8Þ 3 3 2 2 4 2 2 The maximum rate of this reaction is achieved at bed temperatures between 1088 and 1143K, even though a practical range of fluidized-bed operation of 1023(cid:1)1223K is common [1]. All lime and limestone units are designed for 90(cid:1)95% SO removal. Magnesium-enhanced lime systems are designed for 95(cid:1)98% removal 2 [12]. The compound CaSO (cid:4)2H O, produced in this process is gypsum, which is 4 2 either regenerated or used in cement plants. iii. Compared to the combustion temperature of conventional boilers, approxi- mately 1573(cid:1)1773K, the combustion temperature of a FBC is quite low. Combustion at lower temperatures has several benefits: 1. Lower temperature minimizes sorbent requirements because the required Ca/S molar ratio for a given SO removal efficiency is minimized in this 2 temperature range (Figure 5.11) [13]. 100 90 80 70 2.

In addition, reduction in SO (and SO ) in the flue gas means that lower stack 2 3 gas temperatures can be tolerated because less acid is formed as a result of the condensation of water vapor. Lower stack-gas temperatures result in an increase in overall plant efficiency. vi. With a suitable ash cooler, bottom ash is available at a comparatively lower temperature (below 573K), enhancing boiler efficiency. vii. Variation in moisture content in fuel does not cause problems as in the case of conventional boilers. When introduced into the bed fuel gets immediately mixed with the bed material and the water of fuel gets vaporized and superheated on admission. As a result, the dried fuel particles reach the ignition temperature and burn in fluidizing air. viii. Flexibility to use a wide range of fuels in the same boiler.

Even with low-grade fuel FBC boilers will generate rated output. x. Fine coal of size below 6mm [14], which are difficult to burn in conventional boilers, can be efficiently burnt in FBC boilers. xi. Lower combustion temperature, softness of ash, and low particle velocity result in less corrosion and erosion effects. xii. Due to high turbulence in the bed quick start-up and shut down are feasible. xiii. Load following is more appropriate for automation because of inherent high thermal storage. xiv. The boiler is more compact and thus less expensive. xv. Maintenance cost is low since routine overhauls are infrequent. 5.3.2 Disadvantages Some of the typical problems experienced during operation of FBC boilers include: i. Size and shape of the particle plays a vital role. Over-size particles result in improper fluidization and impair the combustion process. Thus efficiency of boiler gets reduced. Too large a particle may lead to smoldering. ii. In the event coal particles become under-sized, some of them may escape the free-board (firing) zone, resulting in burning of fine carbon particles around the cyclone, consequently there will be excursion of flue gas temperature beyond the furnace zone. iii. Fluidizing nozzles sometimes get plugged, inhibiting proper fluidization of the fuel bed. iv. It is very important to maintain optimum fluidizing velocity. In the event that velocity is inadequate incomplete combustion will result. When the fluidizing velocity exceeds the limit, the heat transfer coefficient drops,"

In the event that velocity is inadequate incomplete combustion will result. When the fluidizing velocity exceeds the limit, the heat transfer coefficient drops, causing the bed-wall heat transfer to fall. Erosion may occur in radiant superheater and convective heat-exchanging surfaces. v. Gradual and undetected wear of boiler parts. vi. At times, bed ash gets accumulated when removed manually, and bed height exceeds the permissible limit. A higher bed height may increase bed resistance, resulting in improper fluidization of the bed. As a result, the bed temperature may exceed the recommended upper limit, causing sintering of bed ash and asso- ciated problems. A higher bed height also enhances bed pressure. vii. Bed temperature may exceed the recommended upper limit if the loop-seal air supply is inadequate and/or primary airflow is low. Low primary airflow may also cause the wind-box pressure to rise. Fluidized-BedCombustionBoilers 171 5.4 DESIGN VARIABLES For the design of a fluidized-bed boiler the first step is to calculate the fuel-feed rate according to the required thermal output of the boiler with a targeted efficiency. Then the stoichiometric air supply requirement is calculated, which is further enhanced by the design excess air quantity. It is also essential to estimate the net heat release rate and its utilization to arrive at the temperature of the flue gas. The heat transfer from this hot gas to various heat-absorbing surfaces is then calculated. The next step is to find out the amount of sorbent requirement to ensure sulfur capture as per environment-protection standards. The bed temperature is greatly influenced by fuel composition. For high-sulfur fuel, e.g., pet-coke, the bed temperature has to be maintained at around 1123K for optimum sulfur capture. While low-sulfur low reactivity fuel, like anthracite culms, can be safely operated at a higher temperature to ensure high combustion efficiency. In the case of low-grade fuel less heat is absorbed in the fuel bed and bulk of the heat is absorbed in the convective surface. Bed pressure drop resulting from static weight of solids in the bed is calculated as [1] ΔP5Hð12αÞρ ð5:9Þ p where H: Height of the fixed bed, m α: Fraction not occupied by solids (voids) in fixed bed, dimensionless (the typical value is 0.40, for particles of equal diameter) ρ : Particle density, kg/m3 p The air-distributor grate of CFBC is less critical than that of BFBC, since erosion of bed internals and heat exchanger tubes is a major concern for BFBC.

In CFBC, air-distributor grates are narrow, deep, and operate at much higher velocity to distrib- ute the fluidizing air uniformlyover the cross-section of the bed. Solid wastes produced from fluidized-bed boilers require special design attention, since the total quantity of solid waste is much higher than that produced from an equivalent-size pulverized coal-fired boiler. The amount of sorbent, e.g., limestone, dolomite, etc., required depends on the sulfur content of the fuel, bed temperature, properties of ash content of fuel, emis- sion restrictions, particle size distribution, reactivity of sorbent, etc. Figure 5.12 shows how the amount of sorbent is affected by the bed temperature and sulfur capture rate [15].

The combustion of heat is absorbed from the gas by the heat transfer tubes immersed in the bed and by a conventional water-wall surface. The in-bed tubes can serve as either a steam-generation surface or a superheat surfaceandare used tocontrolthebedtemperature. Althoughanin-bed heat exchanger is a possible source of erosion problems, the close contact with the bed materials and excellentmixingprovidehighheattransfer.Heattransfer intheconvectionpassissimilar tothatforaconventionalstoker-firedorpulverizedcoal-firedsteamgenerator. Figure 5.13 shows a bubbling-bed combustor, where the hot-bed material is in a state of suspension and behaves like a bubbling liquid by fluidized air. The bed tem- perature (1073(cid:1)1173K) is controlled by varying the amount of fuel and air within the bed. Ascoalparticlesizedecreasestoabout250micron,eitherasaresultofcombustionor attrition, the particle is elutriated from the bed and carried out of the combustor. These elutriated particles are then removed as fly ash. This loss of unburned carbon results in a combustion efficiencyof 85(cid:1)90%.

Flue gases are normally cleaned using cyclone, then gases pass through further heat exchangers. The fuel-feed size in this bed is restricted to 30mm in top size, with 20% about 6mm. The BFBC unit size is generally of the order of 25MWe, although larger sizes are also of use for retrofitting existing units. The unburned carbon level is higher than that of a pulverized coal-fired boiler. Another disadvantage of BFBC is that to remove SO , a much higher Ca/S ratio 2 (resulting in higher limestone or dolomite consumption) is needed than for CFBC. This increases costs, in particular the cost of residue disposal. Other disadvantages are higher carbon loss, higher fan power consumption, erosion of bed tubes, etc. Chloride content in fuel accelerates erosion. The bottom ash of this boiler comprises about 30(cid:1)40% of the total ash, with the remaining being fly ash. There are two types of fuel-feeding systems in a BFBC boiler, e.g., under-bed feed and over-bed feed (Figure 5.14) [12]. A comparison of these two types is given in Table 5.4. BFBC boilers are mainly used in township heating systems or in industrial applica- tions. Gas flow path of a typical BFBC boiler is given in Figure 5.15 [7].

This type of boiler is capable of burning low volatile content, typically 8(cid:1)9%, fuel, e.g., pet-coke, and fuels with low ash-melting temperature, e.g., wood, biomass. It can also burn fuels with ash content as high as 70%, e.g., coal washery rejects. Fuels with high moisture content, such as lignite, can also be burnt in this boiler. In a circulating fluidized-bed unit, combustion of heat is absorbed from the gas by a conventional water-wall surface, by platens located in the upper region of the com- bustor, or by a heat transfer surface located in external heat exchangers. The velocityof the gas in a CFBC boiler is relatively higher than that of the solids. The high slip velocity (the difference between the mean gas velocity and the mean solid velocity; see Figure 5.16) [2], in combination with long residence and contact times and intense mixing, results in higher heat and mass transfer rates and higher combustion efficiency in CFBC than are available with BFBC. The circulating fluidized bed, as shown in Figure 5.17 [16], has been developed to improve combustion efficiency and reduce sorbent consumption for required level of desulfurization.

The fur- nace heat release rate in a CFBC boiler is of the order of 3.5(cid:1)4.5MW/m2, which is compatible with that of a pulverized coal-fired boiler. For a bed burning bituminous coal, the carbon content of the bed is only 1%, while the rest of the bed is made up of ash, together with sand and/or lime and calcium sulphate. Because of the small par- ticle size and recycling of solids back to the combustor, the CFBC boiler is able to achieve a combustion efficiency over 98% and a Ca/S ratio of 2.5 for 90% sulfur cap- ture (Figure 5.11). The fuel-feed size in this boiler can be as low as 1.5mm to 10mm top size. Contrary to a BFBC bed, a CFBC bed is not provided with steam-generating tubes. To capture and recycle large bed materials CFBC boilers are provided with big cyclone separators, requiring the boiler to be very tall (Figure 5.18.). The CFBC boiler is used in number of units around 250(cid:1)300MW in size. In a CFBC unit, heat losses from the cyclone(s) are considerable. Thus, the thermal effi- ciency of a CFBC boiler is 3(cid:1)4% lower than an equivalent-size pulverized coal-fired boiler. The operating performance of the CFBC boiler shows that whenever there is a need to increase load on the boiler it can be achieved by raising the bed temperature and keeping the bed material height unchanged (Figure 5.19) [15]. From the operat- ing performance it is further noted that if the bed temperature is maintained the boiler load is linearly related with the bed material height (Figure 5.20) [15]. yticoleV 178 ThermalPowerPlant CCiirrccuullaattiinngg TTrraannssppoorrtt fflluuiidd bbeeddss rreeaaccttoorr Mean gas velocity Slip velocity Inc s r o e l a id s s ing throughout Mean solids velocity Increasing expansion Figure 5.16 Velocity versus bed expansion.

Thus, hot gas can be safely used in a gas turbine since the above properties ensure reduction of corrosion and erosion of gas turbine blades. To harness these ben- efits the pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) boiler was developed in the late 1980s and considerable effort was devoted to the development of PFBC during the 1990s. Today, a PFBC is capable of burning all types of coal, even low-grade coal, be it high moisture, high ash, high sulfur, low gross calorific value (GCV) etc. [11]. This type of boiler is used with a combined-cycle system, incorporating both steam and gas turbines [11]. A PFBC boiler generates steam to drive a steam turbine, while gas fromtheboilerdrivesagasturbine.SuchcombinationofRankinecycleandBraytoncycle along with FBC provides higher cycle efficiency than the efficiency of conventional coal-firing systems, lower emissions, and harmless waste products. The steam turbine produces 80(cid:1)90% of the generated power, and the gas turbine 10(cid:1)20%.

Combustion at high pressure yields the following benefits: 1. More uniform bed temperature distribution 2. Reduced size of boiler island components 3. Lower bed-surface area 4. Reduced maintenance 5. Prevents formation of free lime. The benefits of PFBC relative to AFBC are: i. Specific power output of PFBC is higher, and hence the capital cost is less. ii. Efficiencyof the combined cycle is higher than that of the conventional cycle. iii. Practically all the combustion takes place within the bed and free-board combus- tion is negligible, facilitating gas turbine operation with ease. Along with these benefits PFBC also shares the inherent benefits of FBC, i.e., low SO emissions and less formation of NO than in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. 2 X PFBC units are built to give an efficiency value of over 40% and low emissions. Systems using more advanced cycles should achieve efficiencies of over 45%. As with AFBC, two configurations, e.g., bubbling-bed and circulating-bed, are also possible in PFBC. Currently commercial-scale operating units all use bubbling beds. The combustor and hot gas cyclones in a PFBC are enclosed in a pressure vessel. Bothcoalandsorbent,whichreduceSO emissions,arefedacrossthepressureboundary. 2 Fluidized-BedCombustionBoilers 183 Thebed materialcontains 90(cid:1)95%ofcoalash.The pressurized coal combustionsystem heatssteam,inconventionalheattransfer tubing,andproducesahotfluegas.Particulates are thenremovedfrom the hot fluegasesprior to expandingthe gases throughagas tur- bine.Theexhaustgasesarecooled,generatingmoresteamforpowerproduction. Figures 5.21 and 5.22 show a typical PFBC co-generation plant comprised of a steam generator with its steam turbine, gas turbine, fuel-handling, and ash-handling systems. The fuel is a mixture of crushed coal, sorbent, and water supplied as a paste with the help of piston pumps. The world’s largest PFBC with a capacity of 360MW in Karita, Japan was commissioned in 2000 and began commercial operations in July 2001 [17]. Global application of PFBC, however, is limited due to following requirement/restrictions: i. Feeding coal has to be completely dried, virtually free from surface moisture, to maintain the coal-feed rate to the combustor. ii. The need to pressurize the feed coal, limestone, and combustion air, and to depressurize the flue gases and the ash-removal system introduces significant operating complications. iii. Heat release with each bed area is much greater in pressurized systems, and bed depths of 3(cid:1)4m are required to accommodate the heat-exchange area necessary for the control of bed temperature. iv. At reduced load, bed material is extracted, so that part of the heat exchange sur- face is exposed. v. PFBC has a large thermal capacity. Thus the heating rate of PFBC is much lower than that of the gas turbine, requiring some external arrangement for start-up of gas turbine. vi.

The response of the gas turbine to load change is fast, while that of PFBC is sluggish, and as a result control becomes complicated. viii. A PFBC power plant has huge auxiliary equipment that needs to be controlled along with many final control elements. Thus, the control system required for such a plant is essentially large in scale. 5.8 START-UP AND LOADING OF PFBC BOILERS Prior to starting (black start-up) a PFBC boiler the gas turbine generator is started as a synchronous motor taking its power supply from the grid. This facilitates starting of the gas turbine compressor, which supplies combustion air to the furnace. Then gas or oil-fired bed pre-heaters are lit.

When the bed temperature exceeds the igni- tion temperature of coal(the average temperaturevalueis923K), continuouscoal feed- ing to the bed takes place, and the coal will burn rapidly. When the bed temperature becomes uniform the supplementary firing system is gradually withdrawn. The boiler is now in a position to generate enough steam to run the steam turbine. The hot gas from the burning coal after proper treatment is passed through the gas turbine. As the load is increased the gas turbine generator switches from the synchronous motor to a synchro- nousgenerator.Boththebedtemperatureandmainsteamtemperaturearecontrolledby controlling the coal-feed rate and the bed height simultaneously.

In all heat engines some working fluid is used to which heat is applied, causing it to expand and to perform work overcoming external resistances.

    "text": "to expand and to perform work overcoming external resistances. After completion of the expansion process heat of the working fluid is rejected to a sink. Thereafter, the fluid receives fresh supplyof heat from the source. The working fluid of a steam power plant is “water.” The plant is comprised of a steam generator, in which water receives heat from the heat of combustion of fossil fuels and gets converted to high-energy steam, which then expands through a steam turbine and undergoes changes in pressure, temperature, and heat content. During this process of expansion the high-energy steam also performs mechanical work. The plant also consists of a condenser, where steam rejects heat in cooling water and returns to the original state (Figure 6.1). In addition to fossil fuels, energy from gas turbine exhausts, nuclear reactors, solar, biomass, etc., may also be used to generate steam. Of all stationary prime movers that are used for electric power generation, the steam turbine bears the burden of handling the maximum power demand, which is evident from the status that as of 2012 fossil fuel power plants contributed 67.9% of global electricity generation as against 16.2% by hydropower, 10.9% by nuclear and 5.0% by renewable energy [1]. Compared with other prime movers like equivalent capacity reciprocating engines, the advantages of steam turbines are: i. Require less floor space ii. Lighter foundations iii. Less operator attention iv. Lower lubricating oil consumption v. Oil-free exhaust steam vi. Free from reciprocating vibrations vii. Great overload capability viii. High reliability ix.

A steam turbine is a constant volume machine, i.e., thevolume of the steam flowing at any point within the machine remains unchanged at all loads and is never affected bya change in load. The change in load causes the governing system of a turbine to change the mass flow of steam through the turbine according to the “load demand.” From experimentalresultsithasbeenestablishedthattherelationshipbetweenloadandsteam consumption (i.e., throttle flow of steam) of a turbine is linear in nature and can be represented by the Willans line (Figure 6.8) [3]. The line can be predicted by joining two special points, e.g., throttle flow at the rated-load point and throttle flow at the no-load point.

Various experimental results reveal that steam flow through a turbine is directly proportional to both the nozzle box pressure and stage pressures, but the steam flow is not proportional to the pressures at the last 2 or 3 stages of the low- pressure turbine [3]. This proportionality between the steam flow and steam pres- sure is linear in nature. Combining these two linear proportionalities it can be affirmed that the relationship between the nozzle-box pressure and stage pressures vs. load is also linear in nature and can be represented by a straight line (Figure 6.9). 6.2 TYPE OF STEAM TURBINE In a steam turbine the inlet and exhaust pressures and the inlet temperature of the steam determine the theoretical energy available at the turbine inlet.

    "text": "OF STEAM TURBINE In a steam turbine the inlet and exhaust pressures and the inlet temperature of the steam determine the theoretical energy available at the turbine inlet. To release the energy inside the turbine, steam flows over an alternate series of fixed and moving blades and as a result expands from high pressure to low pressure. A turbine stage con- sists of a stationary set of blades or nozzles, followed by a moving set called buckets or rotor blades. These two different blade types together cause steam to do mechanical work on the rotor. The stationary nozzles turn and accelerate steam converting the potential energy of steam (pressure) into kinetic energy (velocity). The buckets con- vert the kinetic energy of steam leaving the nozzles into both an impulse force (due SteamTurbines 195 Figure6.10 Singlediscsteamturbine. to a change in direction of the steam) and a reaction force (due to a pressure drop across rotating blades), causing the shaft to rotate and generate power. In the simplest single-disc steam turbine the expansion of steam is achieved from its initial pressure to its final one in a single nozzle located in front of the blades of the rotating disc (Figure 6.10). With the drop in steam pressure in the nozzle its heat con- tent reduces, raising the velocity of the steam coming from the nozzle. Thus, the resulting kinetic energy of the jet of steam exerts an impulsive force on the blades performing mechanical work on the rotor. 6.2.1 Impulse and reaction In the impulse design the complete process of expansion of steam takes place pri- marily in stationary nozzles, and the kinetic energy is transformed into mechanical work on the turbine blades without any further expansion. An impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient steam flow into high-speed jets. Moving rotor blades, shaped like buckets, absorb the kinetic energy of these jets and convert it to mechanical work, resulting in shaft rotation as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs only across stationary blades, with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage (Figure 6.11). As steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from steam chest pressure to condenser pressure (or any other pressure as conceived by the designer). Due to this relatively higher ratio of expansion of steam in the nozzle, steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The velocity of steam leaving the moving blades is a large portion of the maximum velocity of steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the “carry over velocity” or “leaving loss” [3]. In contrast, the expansion of steam in the reaction turbine occurs both in"

The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the “carry over velocity” or “leaving loss” [3]. In contrast, the expansion of steam in the reaction turbine occurs both in station- ary or guide blades and in rotating or moving blades such that the pressure drop is about equally divided between stationary and rotating blades. In this type of turbine the expansion and decrease in the heat content of the steam per unit takes place con- tinuously in both guide and moving blade passages. Nozzles and buckets in a reaction turbine are fixed and are designed so that relatively little expansion or pressure drop occurs across them. Upon expanding across the moving blades steam comes out as a high-velocity steam jet that does the mechanical work by the reaction of expanding steam as it leaves the blade wheel. In the reaction turbine rotor blades themselves are arranged to form convergent nozzles. This type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as steam accel- erates through the nozzles formed by the rotor. Steam is directed on to the rotor by the fixed blades of the stator. It leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumfer- ence of the rotor. The steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades. A pressure drop occurs across both stationary blades and mov- ing blades, with steam accelerating through stationary blades and decelerating through moving blades, with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature, reflecting the work performed in driving the rotor (Figure 6.12). erusserp tsehc maetS yticolev maets laitinI selzzon dexiF sedalb gnivoM selzzon dexiF sedalb gnivoM yticolev tsoL erusserp resnednoC 196 ThermalPowerPlant Figure6.11 Changeinpressureandvelocityinimpulseturbine.Source:Fig.2,P5,Introduction[3].

From this discussion it may appear that there are only two basic types of turbines, but in practice most modern turbines are a blend of both principles. Nearly all tur- bines use the impulse principle for preliminary high-pressure stages to reduce losses across blade ends and to raise the steam volume. The low-pressure section consists only of reaction stages. A combined impulse-reaction turbine is simple to construct as well as less expensive to make. To overcome various shortcomings of both types of designs, blades are made twisted, a combination of part impulse and part reaction, etc. (Figure 6.13). Traditionally, General Electric (GE) and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) turbines are impulse type and Westinghouse, Kraftwerk Union AG (KWU), and Parsons turbines are reaction type. 6.2.2 Impulse principle As discussed earlier an impulse turbine is comprised of a stage of stationary nozzles followed by a stage of curved buckets called turbine blades. When a fluid jet impinges on a frictionless curved blade (Figure 6.14: simple impulse stage) the resulting velocity diagram will be as shown in Figure 6.15 [6], where: C : Absolute velocityof steam leaving nozzle and entering the blade 1 C : Absolute velocityof steam leaving the blade 2 U: Velocityof the blade in the horizontal direction V : Relative velocityof steam entering the blade 1 V : Relative velocityof steam leaving the blade 2 α : Nozzle/steam entrance angle 1 α : Steam exit angle 2 β : Blade entrance angle 1 β : Blade exit angle 2 SteamTurbines 199 β P 1 β 2 Figure6.14 Simpleimpulsestage.Source:Fig.19.6,P432,CH19,RotaryExpandersandcompressors[6]. α 1 U β 2 = β 1 α 2 C2 V1 C1 V2 = V1 Vw Figure 6.15 Velocity diagram of an impulse stage.

The fixed blades act as nozzles.

In other words, they also act as nozzles (Figure 6.16). The velocity diagram of a reaction stage is symmetrical as is evident from Figure 6.17.

These turbines may be either coupled directly or through a reduction gear to the driven machine. They may also be classified as condensing, non-condensing, automatic extraction, controlled extraction, regenerative extraction, mixed-pressure, reheat, etc. This chapter focuses on the stationary type of steam turbines with constant speed of rotation. Figure 6.18 presents some of these turbines and shows the relationships between the common types of turbines in terms of pressure levels and division of steam flow.

Rotors oper- ating at temperatures much higher than 673K and having relatively small diameters are made of a single-piece solid forging with the discs directly machined on it. In some designs the first few high-pressure stages are made in one piece with the shaft and on low-pressure stages discs are shrunk on the shaft. Small diameter rotors are made as a solid forging in one piece. The control stage disc is usually large in diameter and is either machined directly on the solid forgings or made separately and shrunk 206 ThermalPowerPlant Figure 6.19 A complete rotor assembly placed in position.

The transverse rigidity of the rotor is very high and the critical speed is usually well above the oper- ating speed.

Since the casing is symmetric around its axis, the shape of the barrel type casing also remains unchanged and leak-proof during start-up, shut down, changes in load, and even under high pressure when the temperature changes SteamTurbines 207 Figure6.20 Aturbinerotorfixedwithadiaphragmsandblades.Source:STEAMTURBINE.Wikipedia theFreeEncyclopedia.

The high pressure (HP) turbine casing houses the HP control valves and may house the HP emergency stop valves (ESVs). High-pressure, high-temperature steam is supplied to the HP turbine from the superheater outlet of the steam generator. In a specific design steam extractions from the HP turbine casing to the HP feedwater hea- ters may also be provided. Similar to HP turbine casing the intermediate pressure (IP) turbine casing has pro- visions for IP control valves and may house IP interceptor valves (IVs). The IP turbine receives medium-pressure, high-temperature steam from the reheater outlet of the steam generator. Contrary to HP turbine casing, all turbine designs keep provisions for steam extractions from the IP turbine casing to the HP feedwater heaters.

The LP turbine casing is connected to the condenser at the LP turbine exhaust area. This casing is always designed keeping provisions for steam extractions to LP feedwater heaters. 6.4.3 Bearings The function of bearings is to carry the full weight of the turbine rotor and allow it to rotate with the least friction. Metal-to-metal contact will ruin the lining of a bear- ing and hence an oil film is established between the stationary surface and the rotor to separate them. There are two types of turbine bearings: journal bearings and thrust bearings. 6.4.3.1 Journal bearings (Figure 6.24) The function of a journal bearing is to support the turbine rotor. The journal bearing is comprised of upper and lower shells with a babbit face. The bearings are supplied with lubricating oil from both sides of the shells. Clearance is provided between the shaft and the bearing surface to accommodate the lubricating oil film. A sustained oil 210 ThermalPowerPlant Bearing Journal Lubrication Attitude angle Figure6.24 Typicaljournalbearing.Source:PLAINBEARING(cid:1)WikipediatheFreeEncyclopedia. film between the shaft and the bearing surface is developed only when the oil pressure is able to balance the weight of the shaft. The shaft center at rest is situated eccentrically relative to the bearing center. With increasing shaft speed, the shaft center tends to reach the bearing center. At infinite speed of rotation both centers will coincide. High-pressure oil, called jacking oil, is supplied under the journals at low speed during start-up and shut-down of the turbine rotor. As a result, dry friction is prevented and breakaway torque during start-up with turning gear is reduced. 6.4.3.2 Thrust bearings (Figure 6.25 and Figure 6.26): Axial thrust on the turbine rotor is caused by pressure and velocity differences across the rotor blades, pressure differences"

The collar and thrust pads permit equal loading of the thrust bearing in either direction.

The slow rotation during start-up and shut-down is carried out to ensure that the rotor remains free from undesirable temporary or permanent defor- mation or sag between long bearing spans due to different temperatures in the rotor sections perpendicular to the axis of the rotor, if left for too long in one position. The turning gear may be located on the bearing pedestal between the LP turbine and either the IP turbine or the generator and is driven either hydraulically or electri- cally. In a typical design the turning gear drives the turbine rotor through a bull gear attached to the rotor shaft. When steam is allowed to enter into the turbine and when the turbine rotor speed exceeds the turning gear speed, the turning gear or the drive pinion is automatically thrown out of engagement or decoupled from the rotor bull gear by centrifugal force.

During shut-down of the turbine as the rotor coasts down when its speed falls below the turning gear speed a low-speed signal re-engages the turning gear. The turning gear may also be engaged manually. Before starting the turning gear, its lubricating oil supply must be ensured. The jacking oil, if required by the design to overcome the initial break-away torque and to prevent dry friction, should also be supplied to lift the rotor before putting the turn- ing gear into operation. In a hydraulically operated turning gear, oil from the jacking oil system should also be supplied by engaging the drive pinion. The turning gear must not be started until the drive pinion is fully engaged. In the event of failure of the normal turning gear, the combined rotor shaft may be rotated manually with the help of a mechanical turning/barring gear. 6.5 METHODS OF TURBINE GOVERNING Speed and power output of the turbine are controlled by varying the steam input to the turbine using throttle valves placed between the steam generator and the turbine. An emergency stop valve precedes the throttle valves and completely shuts off steam supply to the turbine as and when required during normal shut-down and also during emergencies. There are three basic methods of steam admission to the turbine, dis- cussed as follows. 6.5.1 Throttle governing In throttle governing the supply of steam to the turbine is controlled through single batch of nozzles either by a single, two, or multiple control/throttle valves operating in parallel (Figure 6.27). These valves are located in the HP cylinder steam chest. SteamTurbines 213 + Throttle valve Figure6.27 Simplethrottlegoverningwithcommoninletannulus. The steam flow through the turbine is controlled by the throttle valves. The upstream steam pressure at the throttle valves will be constant, irrespective of the turbine loading, but the pressure after the throttle valves will reduce as the valve opening reduces. This will cause the available energy per unit of steam due to expansion to be reduced, as well as the mass flow of steam. This is shown for a non- reheat turbine in Figure 6.28. At the turbine stop valve the steam conditions are 16.8MPa and 838K. At full-load, the loss of steam pressure due to the throttling effect of the turbine stop and the throttle valve is about 5%. Hence, the steam pres- sure after the throttle valve is about 16MPa (point A). The steam does work in the turbine by expansion up to 9.6kPa back pressure. At half-load, the steam pressure"

The steam does work in the turbine by expansion up to 9.6kPa back pressure. At half-load, the steam pressure after the throttle valve will be half of that at full-load, as shown at point C and at 25% load pressure will be one-fourth of the full-load pressure (point E). Although the specific enthalpy of the steam at the turbine inlet remains unchanged, the avail- able energy gets reduced as the loading gets reduced (from AB to CD to EF). This reduction of heat drop and steam flow causes the turbine output to be reduced as the throttle valves close. Nevertheless, efficiency of the expansion remains the same for all loads as is evident from the slope of expansion lines [9]. The main effect of throttling, apart from reducing steam flow, is to reduce adia- batic heat drop. A secondary effect of throttling is to increase initial superheat and to delay the dew point. It should also be noted that throttling incurs losses as the steam pressure and temperature are untowardly reduced. It is not suitable for part-load oper- ation or for fluctuating load demand. 6.5.2 Nozzle governing In nozzle governing, control is necessarily restricted to the first stage of the turbine, and the nozzle areas in the other stages remain unchanged. The first-stage nozzles are 16.8 16.0 8.0 4.0 MPa MPa MPa MPa Temperature divided into a number of groups, from three in a simple system, to six or higher in a more elaborate arrangement. The steam supply to each group of nozzles is controlled by a valve, and the number of valves opened in turn varies according to the load on the turbine. For example, if six valves are opened to meet any given load demand then five of them will remain fully open and the actual control will be taken care of by the sixth valve. Figure 6.29 shows a four-valve arrangement. At standstill all four valves remain closed. Between no-load and 25% load only the first valve starts opening, which opens full at 25% load. The first valve remains fullyopen and the second valve comes into ser- vice between 25% and 50% load, followed by opening of the third valve at 50% to 75% load. Finally, in a fully open condition of the three valves the only valve operating in throttling mode between 75% and 100% load is the last valve, which permits maximum loading of the turbine when opened fully. Thus, the losses due to throttling in nozzle governing are much less than the losses"

The chief advantage of nozzle governing is higher turbine efficiency at part loads because of reduced throttling losses. Therefore, nozzle-governed machines are preferable where the loading regime involves prolonged operation under part-load conditions. 6.5.3 Bypass governing In bypass governing steam is normally supplied through a primary valve and is adequate to meet the bulk portion of the maximum load, which is called the economic load. At lower loads the regulation is done by throttling steam through this valve. When the load demandexceedstheeconomicloadtheprimaryvalveremainsfullyopenandasecondary valve is opened (Figure 6.31). This secondary valve bypasses the first stage and some high-pressure stages and supplies throttled steam downstream of these stages.

The speed governor is a speed-sensing device that senses the change in the magnitude of speed within a preset range and produces a corresponding displacement that can be used as a corrective signal to control the steam flow. However, without some form of droop, the turbine speed regulation will always be unstable. Droop is a straight-line function that has a specific speed refer- ence for every load condition.

It is normally around 3(cid:1)5% of the reference speed over the full range of load. Thus, a 5% droop governor with a reference speed of 3000rpm at 100% load will have a reference speed of 3150rpm at no-load (50Hz at full-load and 52.5Hz at no-load). Utility turbines, connected to the grid, share loads with other running turbines operating in parallel. The grid determines the frequency of the connected alternator of the turbine. In the event the governor speed falls below the grid frequency, the power will flow from the grid and the alternator will act as a motor. Should the governor speed be higher than the grid frequency, the governor will go to full-load to make an attempt to raise the grid frequency. To prevent these problems the droop acts as a savior and causes the governor speed reference to decrease as the load increases. Normally hydraulic governors are provided with adjustable droop, but in most mechanical governors adjustment of droop is difficult. 6.6.1 Types of speed governors 6.6.1.1 Mechanical The earliest known automatic turbine speed governor was a centrifugal fly ball type mechanical governor, which was driven by the main turbine shaft directly or through gearing. The centrifugal force acting on two revolving weights is opposed by the elas- tic force of a spring, so that the weights take up different radius for each speed and produce a proportional displacement of the sleeve linked to the fly balls through hinges (Figure 6.33). 6.6.1.2 Electrical An electrical governor uses robust servomechanism and circuit components. An AC generator, driven by the turbine shaft, provides an electrical signal of a frequency pro- portional to the speed. A frequency-sensitive circuit produces a voltage proportional to this frequency that after amplification is fed to a torque motor that in turn produces a proportional displacement. (Additional details given in section 6.8.) SteamTurbines 219 Spring steel strips Spindle coupled to governor piston Rotating weights Figure6.33 Flyballgovernor.Source:ImagesforFlyballGovernor.GoogleWebPage. 6.6.1.3 Hydraulic Put simply, a hydraulic governor for a turbine consists of a centrifugal pump driven from the turbine main shaft. The pressurized oil from it is fed into a cylinder contain- ing a spring-loaded piston. The pressure is proportional to the square of the speed so that the position of the piston is a function of the speed. 6.6.1.4 Electro-hydraulic An electro-hydraulic governor is a more recent innovation.

The electrical part of an electro-hydraulic-governing system is comprised of equipment for detecting measured values (i.e., control valve lift, speed, load, and initial pressure) and processing of sig- nals. The processed electrical signal is introduced at a suitable point in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic controls provide continuous control of large positioning forces for control valves. The electro-hydraulic converter is used as the connecting link between the electronic modules and the valve actuators. A change from electro- hydraulic governing to hydraulic governing during operation is possible. When one system fails, the other one comes into operation automatically. The displacement of 220 ThermalPowerPlant the piston in a hydraulic governor, of the torque motor in the electrical governor, or of the sleeve of the flyball governor, which is a function of the shaft speed, is used to control the throttle valve of the turbine through hydraulic relay action or mechanical linkages or a combination of both. The governing system in addition to ensuring the falling load-speed characteristics of the turbine, as mentioned above, also ensures the following functions: i. Run up of the turbine from rest to rated speed and synchronizing with the grid ii. Meets system load variations in a predetermined manner, when running in paral- lel with other machines iii.

The servomotors consist of a cylinder and a spring-loaded piston that is held in the open position by admission of high-pressure oil against the spring force. This spring force ensures positive closing of valves when the oil is drained out. The high-pressure oil supplied by an oil pump to the governing system is fed to the servomotors through their pilot valves. The position of the pilot valve determines the opening or closing of servomotor. The high-pressure oil that actuates the servomotor is usually called power oil or control oil.

In the trip position it shuts off the oil supply and drains the oil from the lines downstream of it, thereby ensuring quick closure of emergency stop and control valves. The protection oil being fed to the HP control valve servomotor pilot valve- actuating device is regulated through the speed governor pilot valve (Figure 6.34). The change in speed that causes a corresponding change in governor pilot valve varies the oil pressure, which in turn regulates the position of the control valve through the ser- vomotor and its pilot valve. There are variations in this arrangement. The other gov- erning and protection devices, such as load limiting gear, low vacuum unloading gear, and initial pressure regulator, are hooked up into this control valve governing system through hydraulic relays and linkages. In reheat turbines in cases of partial or full load throw off even after the HP con- trol valves are fully closed, the entrained steam in reheaters and hot reheat steam line is more than enough to speed up the turbine above over speed limits. Hence, it is necessary to provide interceptor valves (stop valves) and control valves on the hot reheat steam inlet line to the IP turbine. While the IP interceptor valve is operated 222 ThermalPowerPlant similar to the HP emergency stop valve, the IP control valve is controlled similar to the HP control valve but at a higher speed range by a secondary or pre-emergency governor as it is called. In specific designs the valve remains fully open at rated speed and starts closing at about 3% over speed and fully closed at about 5% over speed. 6.6.3 Governing devices 6.6.3.1 Speed governor pilot valve The pilot valve consists of a movable sleeve with ports for oil inlet, outlet, and drain inside which the double bobbin valve moves, actuated by centrifugal flyball governor."

The high-pressure oil or protection oil is admitted through the inlet ports of cylinder and sleeve. The pressure of the outlet oil to the control valve servomotor pilot valve- actuating relay is regulated by relative displacement/position of the piston and sleeve. Any change in shaft speed produces a corresponding change in pilot valve position, thereby causing a corresponding change in the control valve opening. 6.6.3.2 Speeder gear A speeder gear is essential in the governing system of turbines in electricity generating stations for synchronizing the machine with the grid and to vary the load when oper- ating in parallel. A speeder gear is needed to match the speed of the turbine to that of the grid while synchronizing. After synchronizing (the speed being determined by the grid frequency) the speeder gear is used to raise or lower load on the machine. The speeder gear is either operated manually locallyor by a small motor remotely. 6.6.3.3 Load-limiting gear This device is incorporated in the governing system to limit the maximum opening of HP control valves to the desired upper limit, in the event of loss of an auxiliary, e.g., boiler-feed pump, ID fan, FD fan, etc. This can be done mechanically by stopping the movement of linkages connected with relays in the control system or by limiting the sensitive oil pressure in the hydraulic system, thereby restricting the movement of speed relay by shutting off or draining the oil. A small motor is usually provided for remote operation of the gear. 6.6.4 Protection devices 6.6.4.1 Emergency trip valve The function of the emergency trip valve has already been explained.

The control operates on each of the emergency stop valves. On reheat turbines, it operates on both the HPemergency stop valves and the IP interceptor valves. The gear is comprised of an additional solenoid-operated pilot valve that releases oil from the steam stop valve power cylinder. When the sole- noid is energized the valve closes rapidly under the action of spring, and the solenoid will de-energize and open the valve when the steam pressure drops. 6.6.4.3 Acceleration-sensing device To deal with the rapid rise in speed that may occur in the event of a sudden loss of load, an acceleration-sensitive governor is fitted. On sudden loss of load this device causes the rapid closure of both the HP and IP control valves. When the acceleration of the turbine ceases the speed will have reduced to such a value that the main gover- nor will keep the acceleration-sensitive governor closed. If for any reason the speed continues to rise, the over-speed governor will come into action and trip the turbine causing closure of the HPemergency stop valves and the IP interceptor valves. 6.6.4.4 Pre-emergency governor The IP control valves/interceptor valves, either independently or along with the HP control valves, are operated either by another centrifugal governor or the same main speed governor byan acceleration-sensing differentiator and pilot valve. The operation 224 ThermalPowerPlant Striker Spring C.G. of striker Relay oil Relay oil Figure6.36 Overspeedgovernor. is similar to an HP control valve. The IP control valves are normally fully open at a rated speed. In a typical case, they will begin to close at a speed above 3% and completely close at 5% above normal. The final speed rise, due to a time delay in the relay operation and the effect of the steam in loop pipes, is about 7(cid:1)8% above nor- mal. The pre-emergency governor does not function during normal operation. 6.6.5 Over-speed governor/emergency governor (Figure 6.36) In the unlikely event of speed increasing to 109(cid:1)111%, emergency or over-speed governors are provided to trip the machine. The emergency governor is normally mounted on the front end of the HP rotor and consists of two strikers for reliability.

Thus strikers, once dislodged from the stable position, continue to move out until checked by the stop of the body. One or more of the strikers flying out will hit the trip levers placed close to the tip, which upon being hit will instantaneously trip the emergency trip valve causing complete shut off of all steam input to the machine (both HP and IP). 6.6.5.1 Testing of strikers by Oil Injection It is necessary to periodically test the strikers to ensure their free movement. This is done by oil injection, without actually raising the speed of the machine. An actual over-speed test can be done in some turbines during start-up or shut-down by tripping the turbine. Provisions are also made in some turbines to test them during operation where the emergency trip valve is kept-gagged in the ‘reset’ position or the over-speed trip level is made out of action by the operator during the test period. A tell-tale indication, e.g. striker will remain in strike-out position till manually reset, is normally provided to show that the striker has flown out. 6.6.5.2 Low-vacuum unloading gear (Figure 6.37 and Figure 6.38) In addition to normal control of the turbine a low-vacuum unloading gear is also pro- vided to gradually close the turbine control valves when the pressure in the condenser rises above a preset value. The device works as follows: Displacement of a bellow con- nected to the condenser vacuum space is used to reduce the control oil pressure directly or by changing the position of the pilot valve, thus reducing the control valve opening. A provision is made on the device by means of which automatic reloading of the turbine with restoration of the condenser vacuum is prevented and reloading is manual. The stroke of the unloading gear is limited so that it can only close the valves down to a no-load position, to prevent the machine from motoring. 6.6.5.3 Initial pressure regulator/initial steam pressure unloading gear (Figure 6.39 and Figure 6.40) The device is similar to low-vacuum unloading gear. If the throttle pressure falls, this device comes into operation and reduces the turbine load by closing the control valves until a balance is reached.

In general, this is done with a device that releases the power oil from beneath the servomotor/relay piston of the valve being tested. Provision is made such that 228 ThermalPowerPlant only one set of valves can be tested at a time with the machine load limited to the capabilityof the other set. 6.7 TURBINE LUBRICATION SYSTEM Lubrication of the steam turbine is required to minimize rotating friction in journal bearings, thrust bearings, and reduction gears as well as to cool the journal and other bearing surfaces. Heat from hot parts of the turbine is also transferred from the shaft to bearings. Heat thus transmitted is carried away by lube oil, thereby maintaining bearing temperature at a safe level. Depending on the size and type of the steam tur- bine and also on their age the lubrication systems of steam turbines vary widely and may fall into either one or a combination of a ring oiling and circulating (pressure or gravity) system. 6.7.1 Ring oiling In small turbines, the oil quantity required for lubrication is small, and the supply sys- tem is relatively simple.

During normal operation, the main oil pump, mounted on and driven by the turbine shaft, draws oil from the main oil tank and discharges it at a high pressure to the bearing lubricating oil system. The lubricat- ing oil pressure is usually maintained constant at about 100(cid:1)150kPa, depending on the particular turbine and bearing design. During the starting and stopping operations of the turbine, when the rotor and main oil pump are not up to the rated speed, an externally driven auxiliaryoil pump is needed to supply the oil. The main oil tank is equipped with vapor extractors to keep the oil tank atmo- sphere free of oil vapor and strainers to arrest suspended impurities. Oil used for the bearing lubricating oil system is cooled in the turbine oil coolers to control the Twin oil cooler Twin oil cooler Pump bearing oil/metal temperature. Thereafter, oil passes through the oil filter to supply dirt-free lube oil to bearings. The oil that has passed through the filter is then led to bearings via a lube oil pressure-reducing regulator. From the bearings the lube oil drains back, by gravity, to the main oil tank, where any heavy impurities that may have been picked up tend to settle out. 6.7.3 Oil coolers Some form of oil cooling is found in all lubrication systems. While direct radiation, water jackets, and simple coils are common in small turbines, separate oil coolers are usually used for circulation systems. They serve to remove the heat developed in bear- ings that in turn maintain low lube oil temperature and retard oxidation of oil. Excessive cooling of the oil, however, is detrimental as it causes precipitation of solu- ble products of oxidation on oil cooler tubes. The water pressure is maintained less than"

The auxiliary oil pumps are particularly useful during starting and stopping of the turbine. ylppus lio ebuL nruter lio ebuL SteamTurbines 229 Twin oil filter Lube oil pressure self acting regulator Generator Twin oil filter Turbine Main oil tank Figure6.41 Typicallubeoilcirculatingsystem. 230 ThermalPowerPlant 6.7.5 Care and supervision of a turbine lubrication system A careful check of the operating conditions of the lubrication systems and proper treatment of oil are important for prolonging oil life and maintaining adequate lubri- cation. In general, the following basic procedures are recommended: 1. Practice a regular method of purifying oil in service using an oil-purification or treatment system. Maintain treatment equipment in good order, e.g., by cleaning or changing filters and cleaning centrifuges and precipitation tanks. 2. Clean oil strainers regularly, usually daily. 3. Drain the bottom of the oil reservoir every day to remove water and other contaminants. 4. Check on water leakage by inspecting the turbine steam and water glands and oil cooler. 5. Check for oil leakage by inspecting bearing seals and oil piping. 6. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for periodic cleaning and overhaul, as the frequency varies widely in different plants with service conditions. Yearly cleaning is generally good practice for most turbines. 7. Check oil level daily, and keep a record of the type and quantity of make-up oil added. Reservoirs of ring-oiled bearings should be drained monthly, and the oil replaced by new or clean oil. In circulation systems, users of inhibited oils should secure a brand of oil for make-up similar to that in the system. 8. When starting, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations, but check whether the mainoilpumpisfunctioningandwhetherthecorrectoilpressureisdeveloped. 9.

While there are various ways of achieving such control, two basic ways, in a very simplified form, are discussed in the following. 6.8.1 Hydro-mechanical speed control A typical hydro-mechanical speed control system is presented in Figure 6.42, where it can be seen that the position of the pointer sets the desired speed of the turbine. SteamTurbines 231 4000 r i Pointer Set speed 3000 R γ 2000 Spring Flyweight Lever α β α δ Raise flow Lower flow To Steam turbine Control valve Figure6.42 Hydro-mechanicalspeedcontrol. The flyweights are located so that their center of gravity lies at a distance of r from i the center of their rotation. These flyweights are connected directly to the output shaft, so their angular speed is proportional to the output speed of the shaft. A lever rotateswith the flyweights as a unit and transmits the centrifugal force from the flyweights to the bottom of a lower spring seat. In the event that the speed of the turbine drops below its reference value the centrifugal force of the flyweight decreases, which in turn causes the force exerted on the bottom of the spring to decrease. The combined effect of such a reduction is to move both α and δ downward. This downwardmovementofδ causesthecontrolfluidtoflowtothebottomof abigpiston raising β upward and opening the flow control valve wider. By supplying more steam/ fuel,thespeedoftheturbinewillincreaseuntilequilibriumisagainreached. If the speed of the turbine exceeds the rated speed reverse mode of actions as above will follow. 6.8.2 Electrical speed control Figure 6.43 shows a typical electrical speed control system. The potentiometer in this control system provides a reference input voltage e , which is proportional to the m desired speed n . The output of the speed pick-up in this control system is voltage e , m d which is again proportional to the controlled output speed n . The error (e (cid:1)e ) is d m d then amplified by the amplifier, whose output e when applied to the field induces a F 232 ThermalPowerPlant Potentiometer e ∞ n m m i e F F Drive Field e d ∞ n d motor Amplifier Speed pick-up Figure6.43 Electricspeedcontrol. field current i, which in turn is proportional to the torque exerted on the rotor by F the drive motor.

Thereby, the speed of the turbine is restored even though the chan- ged load condition is maintained. 6.9 TURBINE LOSSES [3,4] Like the operation of all roto-dynamic equipment, the operation of steam turbines also suffers from various losses. First, loss occurs at the control valves, where a throt- tling loss of about 5% of the main steam stop valve upstream pressure is imminent for speed regulation. Bearings and thrust blocks involve frictional losses. In addition, there is radiation loss as well as more serious losses, as discussed below. The objective of each design is to keep these losses to a minimum. 6.9.1 Fluid friction Friction and eddies cause small pressure drops in the high-pressure nozzle box. Further, loss in the nozzle itself is quite substantial, caused bya change in the direction of the steam flow path while passing through an angle. The high-pressure turbine disc runs in a dense medium, resulting in a considerable fluid resistance called disc friction. In the case of partial admission of steam in the first stage, blades that are not influ- enced by the steam jet idly churn the steam in the casing causing windage loss. In addition, the high speed of the rotor creates a centrifugal force on the steam, causing a portion of the steam to move radially and get dragged by the moving blades. The cumulative effect of all above losses is called fluid friction, the cumulative value of this loss is the highest among all turbine losses. 6.9.2 Leakage Steam leak through turbine gland seals does not perform any useful work, hence results in losses. Leakage of steam also takes place from bearing ends. While flowing through the turbine steam leaks through the clearance between the turbine casing and the tip of the moving blades. Energy contained in leaking steam cannot be utilized for doing any work and is accounted as a loss of available energy. 6.9.3 Leaving loss The exhaust steam from a low-pressure turbine enters the condenser with substantial velocityand the kinetic energy corresponding to this velocity represents a loss of energy. 6.9.4 Supersaturation When superheated vapor expands to point 1 across the saturated vapor line (Figure 6.44) a change of phase should begin to occur.

Condensation of vapor starts at some point 2 in the wet region, such that states of the fluid between point 1 and point 2 are not states of stable equilibrium, but of transient equilibrium. At point 2 condensa- tion of vapor suddenly takes place and the condition of the vapor once again comes back to thermodynamic equilibrium. Between region 1 and 2 the vapor is said to be supersaturated or undercooled [3]. The latter term is adopted to denote that at any pres- sure between points 1 and 2 the temperature of the vapor is always less than the satu- ration temperature corresponding to that pressure. For example, at any given pressure a supersaturated fluid at point y (Figure 6.45) has a lower temperature, about 313K, than if it were in thermodynamic equilibrium (356 K). The locus of point 2 at various pressures is called the Wilson line. 6.9.5 Moisture loss Large steam turbines are designed so that dryness fraction of exhaust steam will not fall below about 88%. In the event that the dryness fraction falls below 88% or the moisture content of the exhaust steam exceeds 12%, the liquid droplets will strike the moving blades at different angles, thereby reducing the mechanical work of the rotor. Some liquid droplets will also get carried away with high-velocity steam and thus with the exchange of momentum reduce the energy content of steam. Higher size droplets will also cause erosion of blade materials. From an operational point of view, contaminants in the steam, such as oxygen causes corrosion, sodium, and chlorine from a water treatment plant, can cause stress-corrosion cracking and erosion.

While heat loss through conduction in a tur- bine takes place both internally among metal parts, and externally between turbine casing and the foundation, convection and radiation losses take place from the high- temperature zone of the turbine casing to its surroundings. 6.9.7 Mechanical and electrical losses Mechanicallosses,e.g.,frictionallossesinbearings,governor mechanism,etc.,areusu- ally constant and independent of load. The turbine must also supply mechanical work to accessories such as oil pumps, etc. In general, mechanical losses are fairly small, amounting to 1% or less of the total available energy. The efficiency of modern large electricgeneratorsisaround98(cid:1)99%,andtheremainingportionisconsideredloss. 6.10 OPERATING REGIME In any steam power plant the operating regime of the steam turbine should be selected to ensure that it will perform the following: i. Provide the minimum thermal stresses in turbine material ii. Ensure the most economical generation of power iii. Require the least demand on operating personnel Normally the steam temperature entering a a turbine is kept as high as permitted by the metallurgical limit of internal materials used in high-pressure and intermediate- pressure turbines. Throughout the operation of a turbine the steam temperature is also maintained constant to harness the benefit of maximum attainable efficiency. Hence, to meet these duties the following three operating regimes are commonly used [9]: 1. Constant pressure operation 2. True sliding pressure operation 3. Modified sliding pressure operation 6.10.1 Constant pressure operation The start-up of a steam turbine from any state, be it cold, warm, or hot, begins from a steady state of reduced steam conditions. During start-up initial (throttle) steam pressure and initial (throttle) steam temperature are selected following the manufac- turer’s guidelines. Once the turbine is synchronized and starts raising loads both pres- sure and temperature are gradually raised to reach their rated conditions. During normal running of the unit the changes in power output are carried out at rated initial steam conditions. However, while reducing load, although throttle steam pressure remains unchanged, the throttle steam temperature is kept unaltered down to a load of about 60% in a typical pulverized coal-fired boiler. Below this load it is imperative to reduce the steam temperature for stability of boiler operation. Nozzle control is normally used for this mode. 6.10.2 True sliding pressure operation When the turbine is started, the initial steam pressure is increased gradually to its rated value beginning at the reduced initial value. During normal operation the main steam flow through the turbine"

During normal operation the main steam flow through the turbine is controlled by sliding the throttle steam pressure progres- sively from the initial value to the rated value in proportion to the generation output, while keeping the turbine control valves fully open. In true sliding pressure operation, changes in both pressure and load take place linearly, attaining 100% throttle pressure at 100% load. At part load the thermal efficiency of the steam turbine operating with true sliding pressure operation will be better than the efficiency of the turbine if it operates with constant pressure operation, due to following reasons: i.

Boiler reheat steam temperature can be higher because of higher temperatures in the high-pressure turbine exhaust steam Another benefit of adopting variable pressure operation is this mode results in extremely fast turbine start-up time. 6.10.3 Modified sliding pressure operation In the case of sudden load demand the turbine control valves can react almost instan- taneously to take corrective action, but the boiler fuel control cannot react with the same speed because of its sluggish response. To address this problem, a modified sliding pressureoperationwithsomethrottlereservehasbecomeattractivetosystemdesigners. With this mode, while throttle steam pressure is raised progressively from an initial value the rated throttle steam pressure is attained at 80(cid:1)85% control valve opening, insteadof100%.Therefore,wheneverthereissuddenloaddemand,theturbinecontrol valves open immediately, allowing more steam to flow through the turbine according to the demand, but with a sacrifice of throttle steam pressure.

CHAPTER 7 Gas Turbine and Heat Recovery Steam Generator 7.1 INTRODUCTION Back in 1500 Leonardo da Vinci (1452(cid:1)1519) sketched a machine, called the “Chimney Jack,” that extracted mechanical energy from a gas stream. Hot air from a fire rose through a series of fans that connected and turned the roasting spit. Giovanni Branca developed a machine in 1629 in which jets of steam rotated a turbine that then rotated the driven machinery of a stamping mill. In 1678 Ferdinand Verbeist built a model carriage relying on a steam jet for power. In 1791 a basic turbine engine was patented with all the same elements as today’s modern gas turbines to power a horseless carriage. However, until the nineteenth century no practical implementation of such machines was considered. That is, until the American engineer George Brayton (1830(cid:1)1892) proposed a cycle consisting of a gas compressor, mixing cham- ber, and expander that used a combustion chamber exhausting to the atmosphere. Intheoriginalnineteenth-centuryBraytonengine,ambientair isdrawnintoapiston compressor, where itis compressed isentropically. The compressedair then runs through amixingchamberwherefuelis addedatconstantpressure (isobaricprocess).Theheated (bycompression)pressurizedairandfuelmixtureisthenignitedinanexpansioncylinder andenergyisreleased,causingtheheatedairandcombustionproductstoexpandisentro- pically through a piston/cylinder. Some of the work extracted by the piston/cylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement. In 1872 German engineer F. Stolze patented a machine that predicted many of the features of a modern gas turbine engine, with a gas compressor, burner (or combustion chamber), and an expansionturbine,buttheengineneverranunder itsownpower. The first gas turbine was built in 1903 by a Norwegian named Ægidius Elling that was able to produce more power than it needed to run its own components. At that time, knowledge of aerodynamics was limited, and Elling’s invention was considered a remarkable achievement. Using rotary compressors and turbines it produced an equiv- alent amount of about 8kW power (substantially high at that time in respect of pre- vailing scenario). Elling’s work was later used by Sir Frank Whittle. The first application for a gas turbine engine was filed in 1914 by Charles Curtis.

Griffith applied the experience of gas flow past air foils into gas flow through passages of a turbine. Sir Frank Whittle patented the design for a gas turbine for jet propulsion in the year 1930. His work on gas propulsion relied on all works carried out earlier in the same field. Whittle once stated that his invention was greatly influenced by the work of Ægidius Elling in the absence of which it would have been difficult for Whittle to achieve his goal. The first successful use of his engine was in April 1937. In the year 1936, Hans von Ohain and Max Hahn of Germany developed their own patented engine design at the same time that Sir Frank Whittle was developing his design in England. All of the aforementioned chronological development led to the first modern gas turbine plant being installed in 1950. The modern-day gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a rotary engine that extracts energy from a flow of combustion gas. The gas is normally air, or products of combustion of fuel and air. The essential features of a gas turbine are [1]: i. Compressor that raises the air pressure ii. Combustion chamber/s in which fuel is sprayed into the pressurized air from compressor for combustion iii. Gas turbine through which high-temperature products of combustion from the combustor pass and are expanded The upstream compressor is directly coupled to downstream turbine, and the combustor or combustion chambers are located in-between (Figure 7.1). The air is compressed in the compressor, after which it enters a combustion chamber where energy is released when air is mixed with fuel and ignited in the combustor. As a con- sequence of the combustion at constant pressure the temperature of air is increased. After leaving the combustion chamber the resulting high-temperature gases are Fuel Exhaust 2 Combustor 3 4 Compressor Turbine G Generator 1 Inlet air Figure7.1 Equipmentofgasturbine.Source:http://file.scirp.org/Html/5-2650044_40880.htm.

Gas turbines for industrial and utility applications have many advantages. Compared with conventional steam power plants with large steam generators and bulky condensers, gas turbines, along with associated systems, are small in size and mass. Thus, the transport of gas turbine units is simpler. Gas turbines offer flexibility in using a range of liquid and gaseous fuels, such as crude oil, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, methane, and distillate “jet fuel,” gas produced by gasification processes using coal, municipal waste, and biomass, as well as gas pro- duced as a by-product of oil refining. Gas turbines are ideal for electricity generation in periods of peak electricity demand, since they can be started and stopped, quickly enabling them to be brought into service as required to meet energy demand peaks. They are smooth running, and their completion time to full operation is the fastest compared to other power gener- ating plants. Gas turbines also have the lowest capital and maintenance costs. They are also subject to fewer environmental restrictions than other prime movers [2]. Theirmaindisadvantage,however,isthehighheatrate,whichrestrictsitsuseforelec- tricitygeneration.Thisrestriction, nevertheless,could be overcome byadopting a higher turbineinlettemperaturebyusinghigh-gradematerialcapableofwithstandinghighmet- allurgical limit. Forevery 55K increase in temperature, the workoutput of a gas turbine unitcanbeenhancedbyabout10%andtheheatratereducedbyapproximately1.5%[3]. Anotherdisadvantageofthegasturbineisitsincompatibilitywithsolidfuels[2]. Therearetwobasictypesofgasturbines:aeroderivativeandindustrial.Aero-derivative unitswereprimarilydesignedasaircraftjetengines,modifiedsubsequentlytodriveelectri- cal generators. They are lightweight and thermally efficient, but usually more expensive than gas turbines built exclusively for stationary applications. Currently, the capacity of a single-unit stationary type of aero-derivative gas turbine is maximum 50MW, with com- pressionratiosintherangeof30:1,usingahigh-pressureexternalfuelgascompressor. Industrial gas turbines are exclusively used for stationary power generation. The capacity of a single unit could be as high as 450MW [4]. Industrial gas turbines have a lower capital cost per kilowatt installed than aero-derivative units. Other benefits of industrial gas turbines over aero-derivative gas turbines are they are more rugged, can operate longer between overhauls, and are more suitable for continuous base-load operation with longer inspection and maintenance intervals, and their compression ratio is low (up to 16:1), requiring no external fuel gas compressor. The disadvantages of industrial gas turbines are they are less efficient and much heavier. 5 Residual heavy Crude oil oil Distillate Natural oil gas Fuel type The fuel to be used in a gas turbine must be free of chemical impurities and solids as these either stick to the blades of the turbine or damage components in the turbine that operate at high temperature.

When natural gas is used, the power output and thermal efficiency of gas turbines are higher than when using most liquid fuels. In contrast, about 6% of liquid fuel is wasted during combustion as compared to 11% for natural gas [5]. The relative maintenance cost is the lowest while firing natural gas in a gas turbine (Figure 7.2). The maintenance costs of a gas turbine are greatly influenced by i. the type of starting (normal/fast) (Figure 7.3), ii. the frequency of starting in a specified period (Figure 7.3), as well as iii. the loading pattern (Figure 7.4). Gas turbines can be used in a varietyof configurations as follows: 1. Simple cycle operation, i.e., a single gas turbine producing power only. 2. Combined heat and power (CHP) operation, which is a simple cycle gas turbine with a heat recovery heat exchanger that recovers the heat from gas turbine exhaust to generate low-pressure steam or hot water. 3. Combined cycle operation in which high-pressure steam generated from recovered exhaust heat is passed through a steam turbine to produce additional power. rotcaf tsoc .tniaM 4 3 2 1 Figure7.2 Effectoffuelonmaintenancecost. 6 FFFaaasssttt ssstttaaarrrttt mmm /// aaa LLL lll ooo sss aaa ttt ddd aaarrrttt /// LLLoooaaaddd NNNooorrr 1/1000 rotcaf tsoc .tniaM 242 ThermalPowerPlant 5 4 3 2 1 Starts per fired hours 0 1/100 1/10 1/1 Figure7.3 Effectofstartingonmaintenancecost. Base load When used in a simple cycle with no heat recovery, the heat left over in exhaust gases from the gas turbine set is substantial, to the extent of 60% or more of heat input to the set, and is lost to the atmosphere, resulting in poor thermal efficiency of a gas turbine. The gas exhausted from the turbine is not only plentiful and hot (673(cid:1)823K), but it also contains substantial amount of oxygen (normally a gas tur- bine operates with 300(cid:1)400% excess air and its exhaust contains about 16(cid:1)18% oxygen). A 50-MW gas turbine might discharge approximately 280kg/s of exhaust gases at about 753K, with an equivalent value of about 580(cid:3)106kJ/hr of energy or approximately 75% of initial fuel input. These factors point to using the hot, oxygen- rich gas in a steam-generating plant, whose steam output will drive a steam turbine. The use of such wasted heat in a heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) is the basis of a “combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)” plant (Figure 7.5). A gas bypass stack and silencers are frequently installed downstream of the gas tur- bine (Figure 7.6) so that it"

A gas bypass stack and silencers are frequently installed downstream of the gas tur- bine (Figure 7.6) so that it can be operated independently of the steam cycle. Silencers are also installed at air inlet to compressor. The approximate site performance of a gas turbine may be predicted by applying the following rule of thumb correction factors based on Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) recommended International Standards Organization (ISO) per- formance parameters [5]: i. For each 0.56K (1(cid:4)F) rise in ambient air temperature above 288K there would be about 0.3(cid:1)0.5% drop in poweroutput, with a proportionate increase in heat rate. ii. For every 305m (1000ft) increase in site elevation above sea level, gas turbine power output would reduce by about 3.3%. iii. For every 25-mmwc inlet pressure drop, power output is expected to be reduced by 0.5% with 0.1% increase in heat rate. iv. For every 25-mmwc outlet pressure drop, the power output is expected to be reduced by 0.15% with 0.1% increase in heat rate. v.

The cycle is comprised of two isentropic and two isobaric processes. The compressordraws in ambient air and compresses it isentropically from position 1 to position 2 at pressure P . Then the compressed air is discharged into a combustion chamber, where fuel is 2 burned, heating that air at constant-pressure from position 2 to position 3.

Figures 7.7 and 7.8 reveal that the steady-flow constant pressure processes during which heat is transferred are no longer constant temperature processes. Hence, the ideal efficiency of the Brayton cycle has to be much less than the efficiency of the 246 ThermalPowerPlant Carnot cycle based on the maximum and minimum temperatures of the cycle. Also, in comparison with the positive expansion work, C (T (cid:1)T ), the negative com- P 3 4 pressor work, C (T (cid:1)T ), is in substantially high proportion, so the net work out- P 1 2 put is quite low. Some of the work extracted by the turbine is used to drive the compressor. Thus, the efficiency of the Brayton cycle is much poorer than that of the Rankine cycle. The net work output and cycle efficiency of an ideal Brayton cycle may be calcu- lated by using the ideal gas law PV5nRTand γ5C /C .

Unlike with the ideal cycle, the efficiency of the real cycle is very much a function of the initial temperature, T , and the maximum temperature T and assumes 1 3 amaximumvalueatanoptimumpressureratioforeachsetoftemperaturesT andT 1 3. In a real cycle, the fluid friction in heat exchangers, piping, etc., results in pressure drop between end points 2 and 3 and also between end points 4 and 1. As a result, the pressure at point 2 would be higher than that at point 3 and the pressure at point 1 would be less than that at point 4. Hence, the pressure ratio across the compressor (r ) would be greater than the pressure ratio across the turbine (r ). pc pt Further, in a real cycle there are mechanical losses in bearing friction and auxili- aries as well as heat losses from combustion chambers, thus these are also responsible for lower efficiencyof a real cycle than that of an ideal cycle.

In a cycle operating with normal pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature, the turbine outlet tempera- ture is always higher than the compressor outlet temperature (Figures 7.12 and 7.13), i.e., T is higher than T and heat addition is from “b” to “c.” The performance of d b this cycle may be improved by adding a surface-type heat exchanger called the regener- ator, where heat from exhaust gases leaving the turbine at “d” is transferred to the compressed gas at “b” before it enters the combustion chamber. In an ideal process, it is theoretically possible to raise the temperature of the com- pressed air entering the combustion chamber from T b to T bv 5T d , while gas leaving the turbine is cooled from T d to T dv 5T b . The effect of the regenerator is to reduce the amount of heat to be supplied from C P (T c (cid:1)T b ) to C P (T c (cid:1)T bv). Thus, while the net work output of the cycle remains unchanged at W 5C fðT 2T Þ2ðT 2T Þg, the corresponding cycle efficiency increases P c d b a because of reduced heat supply.

If the compression takes place further to the left of 1(cid:1)2 the work required to drive the compressor would reduce. Since compressor work reduces the net cycle work output, it is advantageous to keep the compressor outlet temperature low while reaching the desired pressure P . 2 This can theoretically be done by continuous cooling of the compressed gas to keep T at the atmospheric temperature, as shown by the lower horizontal line of 1 Figure 7.15. However, this is not physically possible, so cooling is done in stages. Figure 7.15 shows two stages of compression, 1(cid:1)3 and 4(cid:1)5, and one stage of intercooling where gas is partially compressed from point 1 to point 3, cooled back to point 4 at constant pressure (ideally) p between the stages, then finally compressed to i point 5.

This section will argue that the work ratio may also be increased by reheating the gas after partial expansion in the gas turbine as far as permissible for a given compression ratio without exceeding the met- allurgical limit, thereby increasing the turbine work output and decreasing the effect of component losses. FromEq.7.13itisclear thattheturbineworkoutputcanbeenhancedtheoretically by keeping the gas temperature (T ) in the turbine high complemented with continu- 3 ous heating of the gas as it expands through the turbine.

The net effect is an P 9 8 increase in both work ratio and specific work output. Figure 7.17 reveals that with continuous isothermal cooling and continuous iso- thermal heating we may arrive at a lower horizontal line and upper horizontal line, respectively, in the T-S diagram. If the rest of the cycle is ideal, we may arrive at an ideal Ericsson cycle, which has the same efficiency as a Carnot cycle operating between two extreme temperature limits [7]. It should be noted that by adopting “compressor intercooling” and/or “turbine reheating” although net work output gets increased, the ideal cycle efficiency may decrease, since heat supplied is also increased. The full benefit can only be harnessed if regeneration is also added with compressor intercooling and turbine reheat as shown in Figure 7.18 [6]. The additional heat required for the colder air leaving the com- pressor at point 4 is obtained from the hotter exhaust gases from turbine at point 9. The hotter air then enters the combustion chamber at point 5, resulting in a gain in ideal cycle efficiency along with increased work output.

As the air temperature rises due to compression water is injected in the air, and the heat of vaporization of water then reduces the air temperature. As a result compressor work gets reduced. By adopting this method the higher power output of a gas-turbine cycle may be obtained with marginal gain in efficiency. Figure 7.20 shows a schematic arrangement of water injection between compressor and regenerator.

In separate production of electricity some energy must be rejected aswaste heat, whereas in separate production of heat the potential for production of high quality energy (electricity or work) is lost. The co-generation plant uses the available energy in more conservative way than that used in either a steam power plant or a process steam plant. Co-generation, therefore, is thermodynamically the most efficient use of fuel. This plant captures the byproduct heat for domestic heating or industrial heating, as in chemical industries, paper mills, etc. Heat remaining in the exhaust gases from gas turbine plants is used as the source of energy to steam generators of co-generation plants for generating steam, which is subse- quently used in steam turbines. Steam turbines in a co-generation plant may be of two configurations, i.e., a back-pressure turbine and a pass out turbine. The back-pressure turbine is usually employed if the power generated by the expanding steam from the initial steam pressure down to the required process steam pressure is more than the power required by the process. Power and heat demand must be fairly steady and well"

The exhaust steam of the turbine is supplied to the process and gets entirely condensed. Depending on the quality of the condensate, it may or may not be returned to the steam generator. This plant, however, suffers from the following limitations: i. If there is a demand for power supply there should be an equivalent quantity of process steam demand and vice-versa. ii. If the power demand reduces, the process steam supply has to be reduced propor- tionately and vice-versa. iii. In the event process steam is shut-down, an additional dump condenser will be required for handling the exhaust steam. These limitations may be overcome if a pass-out turbine is used instead. A co- generation plant employing a pass-out turbine is depicted in Figure 7.22. This turbine may be considered as a combination of two turbines, i.e., a high-pressure section that drops the steam pressure at the turbine inlet to the steam pressure required by the pro- cess, while a low-pressure section handles the steam flow to develop the required power by the process. However, this steam flow is not required by the process and expands to the condenser pressure. 7.4.6 Combined cycle (Figure 7.5 and 7.23) When the ratio of power generation to heat demand is high, the combined cycle plant becomes attractive. In a combined-cycle power plant both gas and steam turbines sup- ply power to the net work. The heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) lies within the gas turbine and the steam turbine. The heat associated with the gas turbine Steam Steam Heat generator Turbine Generator Process Circulating water Condensate Water Pump exhaust is used in the HRSG to produce steam that drives a steam turbine and gener- ates additional electric power. When heat is used to generate steam this way, the whole plant becomes a binary unit. This joint operation of the gas turbine and the steam tur- bine is called a combined-cycle power plant. Thermodynamically, this implies joining a high temperature (1373(cid:1)1923K) Brayton (gas turbine) cycle and a moderate and low temperature (813(cid:1)923K) Rankine cycle, employing features of both the cycles to achieve an overall thermal efficiencyof about 50% that is simply not possible"

The combination most widelyaccepted forcommercial power genera- tion is “a gas topping cycle” with “a water-steam bottoming cycle.” In most applica- tions, the steam turbine (ST) will produce approximately 30(cid:1)35% of the total plant output, with the remaining 65(cid:1)70% being supplied by the gas turbine (GT). This cycleis characterized byflexibility,quickpart-load starting,suitability for both base-load and cyclic operation, and a high efficiency over a wide range of loads. The only disadvantage is in their complexity in combining two technologies in one plant. Combined cycle power plants also have low investment costs and short construction times compared to large coal-fired power stations.

The Cheng cycle has the potential to increase the out- put of a simple cycle gas turbine by 70% with decrease in heat rate by about 40% based on manufacturer’s design parameters [11]. 7.5 GAS TURBINE SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT Depending on its size, location of installation, operating environment, and the propri- etary design a gas turbine unit may include some or all of following systems and equipment: i. Air intake system ii. Anti-icing system iii. Evaporative cooling system iv. Exhaust system v. Starting system vi. Lubrication and power oil system vii. Hydraulic and pneumatic control system viii.

Spark plugs and igniter xvii. Flame monitors xviii. Turbine section 266 ThermalPowerPlant 7.5.1 Air intake system The air intake system usually consists of an integrated air cleaning filter housing, silencer, expansion joint, inlet manifold, etc., leading to the compressor suction of the turbine. The filter elements prevent compressor fouling, erosion, and physical damage to compressor blades that may take place if the amount of the airborne dirt and contaminants is more than 25(cid:1)30 microns. The dirt that accumulates on the fil- ter elements is cleaned by the jets of compressed air in the counter direction of the main flow. 7.5.2 Anti-icing system Anti-icing systems prevent formation of ice in the air intake system and on compres- sor blades when the ambient air temperature falls below a low temperature, say 1280K, while the relative humidity is at or above 70%. This system warms the com- pressor intake air by circulating hot air from the compressor exhaust and then mixing hot air with the intake air. 7.5.3 Evaporative cooling system The evaporative cooling system is used to raise both power output and efficiency of gas turbines. The power output and efficiency rating of gas turbines are usually based on ISO conditions (inlet air temperature 288K and 65% relative humidity). If the inlet air is hotter and drier than ISO conditions, the power of the gas turbine decreases. The purpose of the evaporative system is to cool the intake air by introduc- ing"

If the inlet air is hotter and drier than ISO conditions, the power of the gas turbine decreases. The purpose of the evaporative system is to cool the intake air by introduc- ing water in the air system, where evaporation energy of water reduces enthalpy of air, resulting in increase in compressor inlet mass flow. 7.5.4 Exhaust system Hot exhaust gases coming from the gas turbine are evacuated to the atmosphere through a stack. The gases pass through a silencer to attenuate the sound of the exhaust gases before being released. In the exhaust system an expansion joint is pro- vided to compensate for thermal expansion in the exhaust ducting. 7.5.5 Starting system Before admitting fuel into the combustor a gas turbine must be started by a start-up device. This start-up device may be either an AC motor, a diesel engine, or a “static starting device.” With the help of a start-up device the gas turbine is accelerated to its ignition speed when the turbine burners are ignited. Once the flame is stabilized in the combustor the turbine accelerates further, exceeding its self-sustaining speed, resulting in the start-up device automatically disconnecting and the turbine governor taking over and accelerating the set to synchronous speed.

The hydraulic protection system protects the gas turbine from serious damage in the event of control system failure. The hydraulic control system operates the variable inlet guide vane mechanism and fuel regulation system. The pneumatic control system controls compressor blow-off valves. 7.5.8 Fuel gas system (Figure 7.27) Prior to supplying fuel gas to the gas turbine skid the incoming gas is treated in a “knock-out drum” (KOD) followed by a “filter separator” unit to strip the gas of all solidsandliquids.Anysolidparticlecarriedwiththegasstreamisseparatedfirst.Liquid separation takes place subsequently. Thereafter, the fuel gas may enter into a booster compressorforboostingthegaspressuretothepressurerequiredbythegasturbine. The compressor discharge is sent to the gas coolers to limit flue-gas temperature to comply with the requirement of the gas turbine. The cooled gas is then passed through another set of filters to remove any liquid condensed after cooling of the compressed gas before the fuel gas is conveyed to the fuel gas skid of gas turbine. Fuel gas flows into the gas turbine burner zone when both the main and burner gas shut-off valves are opened. During start-up the pilot gas valves are opened for ignition.

A fuel oil treatment system is provided near storage tanks to remove the water-soluble sodium (Na1) and potassium (K1) salts in the fuel oil to a level equal to or better than that acceptable to the gas turbine operation. The treated oil is then taken to the suction of fuel-oil forwarding pumps of the fuel oil skid of the gas turbine. The fuel oil pump forwards the fuel oil to the burners at adequate pressure needed for atomization. The fuel oil is supplied to the burners only when the main oil shut- off valve is opened. The control valves of the burners are then gradually opened for ignition of oil and thereafter open further as per the load demand. During shut-down of the set, all control valves and shut-off valves are closed. 7.5.10 Water injection system Water is mixed with fuel oil, primarily for the reduction of NO emission. The mix- X ing also enhances the output power from the machine.

The governing system serves the fol- lowing basic control functions: i. Start-up control ii. Frequency/load control iii. Firing temperature control iv. Emergency shut-down control 7.5.11.1 Start-up control The start-up control regulates fuel flow to the gas turbine during start-up of the turbo-set until the nominal speed is reached. It also controls the fuel-air ratio so the outlet gas temperature does not exceed the permissible limits at maximum accelera- tion. Once the turbine speed matches the grid frequency the unit is made ready to be synchronized with the grid. 7.5.11.2 Frequency/Load control The frequency/load controller comes into action during idling, synchronization, and normal operation of the turbine. Once the turbine accelerates to operating speed the start-up control mode is switched over to the frequency/load control mode. This controller derives the set point for the turbine load from the output of the frequency controller. The fuel flow to the turbine is then controlled to generate the desired power output. 7.5.11.3 Firing temperature control The temperature controller regulates the rate of the fuel addition during the accelera- tion stage of the turbine so that the turbine is not inflicted with over temperature condition.

It also maintains the minimum fuel flow to the com- bustor so the flame does not blowout, leading to trip gas turbine. 7.5.11.4 Emergency shut-down control The emergency shut-down control protects the gas turbine from serious damage whenever any control system fails. 7.5.12 Firefighting system At any place around the plant a fire may start accidentally due to shortcircuiting or ignition of fuel and lubricants or of common combustible materials, e.g., paper, GasTurbineandHeatRecoverySteamGenerator 271 cotton waste, etc. A number of portable/semi-portable soda-acid type fire extinguish- ers are provided at various places to fight minor fires as soon as they are detected. The fuel oil system is protected from fire by a foam and spray water system. The generated foam provides a blanket over the oil surface and cuts off the oxygen supply, which is essential for supporting combustion. As an alternative means, sand stored in the bins near the dyke walls of the fuel oil storage tanks can also be used to prevent outbreak of minor fire. Sand is sprinkled evenly on the spillage surfaces by using a shovel or bucket. Small fires can also be handled successfully using sand. Ordinary water is not generally suitable for fighting oil fire, as oil has a tendency to float and spread further. Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers are used for fighting electrical fire. Wherever it is practicable, the electric supply to the equipment on fire should be switched off before using the extinguisher. In the event of a big fire, the portable/semi- portable extinguishers may prove ineffective. In such cases, the central firefighting team should be called in as soon as possible. 7.5.13 Compressor unit The air compressor used in a gas turbine is made up of several rows of blades. The compressor develops a high-compression ratio and ensures an adequate air supply to combustors. The compressed air may be withdrawn from the compressor and directed to the parts in the hot gas path in the turbine zone to cool that zone. Axial flow compressors are used in all larger gas turbine units because of their high efficiency and capacity. Centrifugal compressors are more stable than axial flow ones but of much low capacity and not as efficient. Axial flow compressors experience surge problem during start-up, low-load, and low-speed operations. Axial flow com- pressors used in gas turbine power plants must be designed to avoid operation in"

Axial flow compressors experience surge problem during start-up, low-load, and low-speed operations. Axial flow com- pressors used in gas turbine power plants must be designed to avoid operation in such instability region, which is damaging to the equipment. To avoid compressor instability under these conditions any or a combination of the following methods are used, inter-stage bleed, discharge bleed, variable compressor inlet vanes, turbine vari- able vanes, and bypass to ensure fast and smooth starting and low-load operation of the gas turbine. 7.5.14 Combustion components The combustion system consists of a combustor, burners, igniter, and flame monitors. The combustor must bring the gas to a controlled uniform temperature with minimum impurities and minimum loss of pressure. The major problems of combustor design, in addition to clean combustion and proper mixing of gases, are flame stabilization; elimination of pulsation and noise; reduction of pressure loss; and maintenance of steady, closely controlled outlet temperature. The gas turbine power plants are 272 ThermalPowerPlant arranged with single or multiple combustors. The single combustor design is easier to control but is larger and less compact than the multiple types. The combustor is placed between the turbine and the compressor within turbine casing. It is a direct-fired heater in which fuel is burnt to supply heat energy to the gas turbine. The air flow through the combustor has three functions: to oxidize the fuel, to cool the metal parts, and to adjust the extremely hot combustion products to the desired turbine inlet temperature. The temperature of the gas in the combustors and entering the turbine can reach up to 1623K or even more. Usually low NO X burners are used to reduce the concentration of NO in the exhaust gas to less than X 25ppm at full load. Sometimes water or steam can be injected into the combustors to reduce the concentration of NO in the exhaust gas. X The primary zone of the combustor accommodates burners. Gaseous fuel is admit- ted directly into each burner and mixes with air. When liquid fuel is used it is atom- ized in the nozzle using high-pressure air. The atomized fuel/air mixture is then sprayed into the combustor. During oil firing, water is mixed into the oil to ensure low NO emission level. X Igniters are used for initial ignition of the fuel-air mixture during start-up of the gas turbine. Once energized, the spark plugs of the igniters start to spark and ignite the mixture of ignition gas and air. The main fuel then flows into the combustor through burners and is ignited there by the ignition flame."

The main fuel then flows into the combustor through burners and is ignited there by the ignition flame. The flame then spreads from burner to burner without further sparking once these burners are supplied with fuel. After ignition is accomplished, the spark plug is switched off. Flame monitors are installed in the combustor to indicate the presence or absence of flame. The flame monitor is sensitive to the presence of radiation, typicallyemitted by a hydrocarbon flame. 7.5.15 Turbine section Power required to drive the compressor, various auxiliaries, and the load package is suppliedbytheturbinerotor.Turbinesingasturbineplantsarealmostalltheaxialflow type, except for a few smaller sizes, which are radial flow.

When the turbine is at a standstill the variable inlet guide vanes remain in the closed position. During start-up, the variable inlet guide vanes are opened to their predefined starting position. When the turbine starting system is actuated ambient air is drawn through the air inlet assembly, filtered and compressed in the compressor. To reach the optimum efficiency with the lowest emissions, the air flow is controlled by variable inlet guide vanes. GasTurbineandHeatRecoverySteamGenerator 273 1. Inlet section 2. Compressor 3.

It produces steam that can be used in a process or used to drive a steam turbine. A common application for HRSG is in a combined cycle power plant, where hot exhaust from a gas turbine is fed to a HRSG to generate steam, which in turn drives a steam turbine (Figure 7.23). This combination produces electricity more efficiently than either a gas turbine or steam 274 ThermalPowerPlant turbine alone, as explained earlier.

HRSG is also an important component in co- generation plants. Where the HRSG supplies at least part of the steam to a process, the application is referred to as co-generation. The exhaust from a gas turbine is directed to the HRSG, which is designed to accept the maximum exhaust temperature and gas flow of the connected gas turbine. It may be of either vertical or horizontal design for natural or controlled circulation. HRSG can be designed with one to four separate operating pressure circuits to optimize heat recovery and cycle efficiency. Low-pressure steam may be used in deaeration and feedwater heating, thus avoiding the steam extraction regenerative feedwater heating used in conventional power cycles. However, conventional power cycle may also be followed depending on cycle configuration. Gas turbine exhaust concurrently supplies sensible heat and oxygen to the furnace of asteamgenerator.Ahighlevelofoxygenremaining inthegasturbineexhaust(16(cid:1)18% oxygen)maybeusedasanoxygensourcetosupportfurthercombustion.Supplementary (or duct) firing systems can be installed upstream of the HRSG.

Generally,ductfiringprovideselectricaloutputatlowercapitalcostbutinferiorefficiency comparedwithcombinedcyclegeneration.Itisthereforeoftenusedforpeaking.

The gas turbine was firing 8.8kg/s of fuel with 425.0kg/s of air ii. The HRSG was receiving exhaust gas from above gas turbine at a temperature of 862K 7.6.1 Design Temperatures available in the furnace of conventional steam generators by combustion of fuel arevery high (1200(cid:1)1500K, depending on the type of fuel), while gas turbine exhaust temperatures upstream of HRSG are very low (673(cid:1)823K). The design of Steam production capability HRSG thus becomes critical since fall in its inlet gas temperature will affect the energy absorbed in various heat transfer surfaces, especially the economizer, and even- tually the exit gas temperature from the HRSG. Hence, to determine the steam gen- eration and to predict gas-steam profiles, an economic design of HRSG is ensured considering the following five key parameters: 1. Allowable back-pressure 2.

The back-pressure is significantly influenced by the HRSG cross-sectional flow area. Higher back pressures reduce HRSG cost but also reduce gas turbine efficiency. Thus, from a techno-economic standpoint back-pressures that are typically maintained at HRSG inlet are 2.50(cid:1)3.75kPa. The best place to locate the superheater would be in the hottest area of the gas path. Since, at this location, it would take the least amount of surface to exchange the maximum heat to generate the hottest steam at the highest pressure. The superheat attemperator to desuperheat steam may be placed at the outlet of the superheater, or at an intermediate position in superheat heat exchange path. The intermediate position, however, has an added advantage of preventing accidental entry of water that may damage downstream equipment. HRSG is generally designed for natural, “thermosiphon” circulation. A vertical- tube HRSG generating very high steam pressure, however, may be designed with forced circulation system. The water is distributed within an inlet header to various parallel circuits and the steam and water mixture is collected in an outlet header and returned to the drum for separation of steam and water. An HRSG without supplementary firing is generally designed with a circulation ratio of 5:1. However, suffice it to say that one with supplementary firing may be designed with a lower circulation ratio of 3:1. Figure 7.32 depicts a simple, single- pressure HRSG with the usual disposition of superheater, evaporator, and economizer sections. A detailed flow scheme of a dual-pressure cycle with deaerator is shown in Figure 7.33 that is comprised of an HRSG with two steam circuits, one high-pressure (HP) and one low-pressure (LP) circuit. While the HP steam feeds the HP turbine, the latter feeds the LP turbine. Each of the circuits has its own economizer, steam drum, evaporator, and super- heater.

The condensate extraction pump draws condensate from the condenser hotwell and then circulates the condensate through two closed-type feedwater heaters (FWH & CPH) and deaerator. From the deaerator feedwater storage tank one high pressure boiler feed pump (HFP) and one low pres- sure boiler feed pump (LFP) take their suctions. Feedwater line from LFP discharge after passing through a low pressure economizer enters the low pressure drum, fol- lowed by low pressure evaporator and low pressure superheater, wherefrom super- heated steam is transported through the low-pressure steam turbine to deliver power. Similarly feedwater line from HFP discharge passes through the high-pressure econo- mizer, steam drum, evaporator and superheater in that sequence. This superheated steam enters the high-pressure stage of the same steam turbine to boost power generation. The pinch point temperature and approach temperatures have a significant impact on the overall unit size. While small pinch point and superheater approach temperatures result in larger heat transfer surfaces and higher capital costs, the economizer approach temperature is typically set to avoid the economizer steaming at the design point. 278 ThermalPowerPlant Pinch and approach points are selected in unfired mode at design gas flow and inlet gas temperature conditions. Once they are assumed, the surface areas of the HRSG evaporator, superheater, and economizer are indirectly fixed or considered selected. Once selected, pinch and approach will vary with other conditions of gas flow and steam parameters. The evaporator pinch is defined as the temperature difference between the flue gas leavingtheevaporatorandthesaturationtemperatureofthefluidflowingthroughevapo- rator. The evaporator pinch limits the amount of heat that can be recovered in most HRSG designs.

Too lowan approach may result in steaming in the economizer,whichmayupsettheoperationatcertainoperatingconditions.Nevertheless, justbecausetheeconomizer issteaming,doesnotnecessarilymeanitisaproblem. During the design stage itself the effect of steaming in the economizer could easily be overcome by taking the appropriate steps and factors. Most designs, however, are conservative and avoid this condition. In general, an average approach to the econo- mizer is considered to be 11K at the design stage, which is expected to ensure smooth, trouble-free operation. There are, however, many units in operation where the approach to the economizer is almost nil. The higher the approach in superheaters, the less surface it will take to exchange heat. As a result, most of the flow in these sections is counter current to the gas flow, which provides a higher approach. For a lower approach steam flow through the superheater is usually cross flow to flue-gas flow. The absolute value of the superheater approach, however, does not affect the overall design of HRSG much. The following ranges of pinch point and approach provide an economical and technically satisfactory design of HRSG, although a specific design may consider dif- ferent values based on economical considerations: (cid:129) Evaporator Pinch Point: 8 to 28K (cid:129) Superheater Approach: 22 to 33K (cid:129) Economizer Approach: 6 to 17K Theminimumflue-gasexitorstacktemperatureneedstobecontrolledtoavoidcorrosion due to acid condensation.

CHAPTER 8 Diesel Power Plant 8.1 INTRODUCTION In 1885, the English engineer Herbert Akroyd Stuart invented an engine using paraf- fin oil as the fuel. This was the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurized fuel injection system. This engine adopted a low-compression ratio, so the compressed air did not have adequate temperature in the combustion chamber to initiate ignition of fuel. Hence, the combustion of oil used to take place in a separate chamber called the “vaporizer” mounted on the cylinder head, which was heated externally by an oil lamp to raise the temperature of the chamber sufficient enough to ignite the oil. Compressed air from the cylinder is passed through a constricted passage into the vaporizer, where oil is then sprayed and ignited by the temperature of the vaporizer chamber for combustion. In 1892 Thomas Henry Barton built a high-compression internal combustion engine, thus eliminating the use of a separate vaporizer. Credit for the invention of the modern diesel engine, however, goes to French engineer Rudolf Diesel. In 1892 Diesel adopted a high compression ratio in his engine, where air could be compressed so much that the temperature attained by air far exceeded the ignition temperature of the fuel, thereby ensuring appropriate combustion of the fuel gradually introduced into the combustion chamber. Diesel’s original 1897 designed engine is depicted in Figure 8.1. A diesel power plant uses a diesel engine, similar to one developed by Rudolf Diesel, as the prime mover for the generation of electrical energy. This engine, also called a compression-ignition engine, is a reciprocating internal combustion engine. Unlike a spark-ignition engine, a diesel engine uses the heat of compression of air to initiate ignition and burning of the fuel in a combustion chamber. Of all type of standard prime movers of equivalent size, whether internal or exter- nal combustion types, the diesel engine has the highest thermal efficiency (almost 52%) due to its very high compression ratio. Low-speed diesel engines can have a thermal efficiency greater than 50% [1]. A diesel power plant is generally compact. The largest unit at the time of writing is about 85MW, which was put into service aboard a container"

Today’sdieselenginesemitlessnoiseandgenerallydonotrequiremuchmaintenance. Diesel engines are classified as two-stroke and four-stroke engines. While most diesel engines, particularly of domestic type, generally use the four-stroke one, larger engines are usually two-stroke type. Domestic diesel generator sets require DieselPowerPlant 287 single-phase power supply, whereas industrial or commercial application generators usually require three-phase power. Most diesel engines have large pistons and therefore draw more air and fuel, which results in bigger and more powerful combustion. In internal-combustion engines, it is presumed that the combustion process occurs at either constant pressure or at constant volume or by a combination of these two processes. The constant-pressure process is observed in the slow-speed compression-ignition (C.I.) or Diesel cycle; the constant volume process is noted in the spark-ignition (S.I.) or Otto cycle; combination of these two processes, however, is called mixed or limited-pressure cycle and appears in high-speed compression-ignition engines. Compression ratio (CR) of an internal combustion engine is defined as the ratio of “the volume between the piston and cylinder head before and after a compression stroke.” In the Diesel cycle mixing of air and fuel takes place near the end of com- pression, while in the Otto cycle mixing takes place before compression. In the diesel engine the heat of compression is used to initiate ignition to burn the fuel, while in the Otto cycle a spark is required to begin combustion of fuel. The Diesel cycle can operate with a higher compression ratio than the Otto cycle because only air is com- pressed in the Diesel cycle while a charge"

The Diesel cycle can operate with a higher compression ratio than the Otto cycle because only air is com- pressed in the Diesel cycle while a charge of fuel-air mixture is compressed in the Otto cycle. As a result there is no risk of auto-ignition of the fuel in the Diesel cycle. In compression-ignition engines no separate source of ignition energy, like a spark plug, is required for igniting fuel. These engines use liquid fuels of low volatility. In the dieselenginethemostcommonworkingfluidisair,whichisintroducedintothecombus- tion chamber to burn fuel. The air is compressed with a compression ratio, typically between 11.5:1 and 22:1, resulting in a compression pressure ranging between 2.8MPa and 4.8MPa [3]. This high compression heats the air to 823K, then fuel is injected directlyintothecompressedair inthecombustionchamber.Thefuelinjectorensuresthat the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and is distributed as evenly as possible.

The compression pressure ranges from below 0.7MPa to 2.0MPa. S.I. engines use carburetors and fuel injection systems. Load and speed are usually controlled by throttling the charge [3]. The combustion process in an internal combustion engine is governed by the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder. In a typical compression-ignition engine burning hydrocarbon fuels the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is 14.9. The limiting relative air-fuel ratio for combustion atfullloadrangesbetween1.2and1.6[4]. 288 ThermalPowerPlant 8.1.1 Advantages of diesel power plant over steam power plant 1.

Mean Effective Pressure, or in short M.E.P., is defined as the mean pressure that, if imposed on the pistons uniformly from the top to the bottom of each power stroke, would produce the net work of the cycle. A cycle operating with large M.E.P. will produce large work output per unit of swept volume. Asaresultsizeof anenginebasedonthiscyclewillbesmallforagivenoutput. For naturally aspirated four-stroke diesel engines, the maximum M.E.P. is in the range of 700 to 900kPa. Two-stroke diesel engines have comparable values of M.E.P., while very large low speed diesel engines may have a M.E.P. up to 1900kPa. 8.1.4 Four-stroke engine A four-stroke engine comprises of the following: i. Induction stroke: Air is drawn into the cylinder. ii. Compression stroke: The air is compressed and just before the piston reaches the top dead center liquid fuel is sprayed into the cylinder. The temperature of the air at the end of compression is significantly high to vaporize the liquid droplets and ignite them. DieselPowerPlant 289 iii. Expansion or working stroke: Combustion is almost completed at the start of the expansion stroke, where the product expands and pressure falls steadily. As the exhaust valve opens blow-down occurs and the pressure in the cylinder becomes slightly more than the atmospheric pressure. iv. Exhaust stroke: The gases remaining in the cylinder at the end of the expansion stroke are displaced by the piston during the exhaust stroke. 8.1.5 Two-stroke engine In a two-stroke engine the induction and exhaust strokes are eliminated and part of the compression and expansion strokes are used for exhaust and induction. At the end of the compression stroke the inlet port opens and air is admitted to the cylinder, while at the end of the expansion stroke the exhaust port is opened to allow blow- down of gases. Eventually the piston stroke of this engine is longer than that of a four-stroke engine of the same capacity. The relative advantages/disadvantages of four-stroke and two-stroke engines are as follows: 8.1.6 Advantages of four-stroke engines i. Better scavenging, hence higher M.E.P. ii. More flexibility iii. Low fuel and lubricating oil consumption iv. Less noisyexhaust v. Compression better maintained, since the engine runs cooler, and the average load on the piston rings is less vi.

The following sections discuss these cycles in detail. 8.2.1 Diesel cycle Figure 8.2 and Figure 8.3 depict the P-v and T-s diagrams for an ideal Diesel cycle, where P is the pressure and v is the specific volume. The ideal Diesel cycle follows four distinct processes: compression, combustion, expansion, and cooling. The cycle follows the numbers 1(cid:1)4 in the clockwise direction. (cid:129) Process 1 to 2 is a isentropic compression process. The air is compressed isentropi- cally through a volume ratio v /v . During this process work (W ) is done by the 1 2 in piston compressing the working fluid. (cid:129) Process 2 to 3 is a reversible constant-pressure heat addition process. Heat (Q ) is in supplied by combustion of the fuel while the air expands at constant pressure to volume v during this process. 3 (cid:129) Process 3 to 4 is an isentropic expansion process to the original volume v . Work 1 (W ) is done by the working fluid expanding on to the piston, which produces out usable torque. (cid:129) Process 4 to 1 is a reversible constant volume heat rejection (cooling) process. During this process heat (Q ) is rejected by exhausting air until the cycle is out completed. The stages of these four processes are discussed in the following.

However, due to delay in the opening and closing of the inlet and exhaust valves, the inertia of inlet air and exhaust gas, each of the strokes invariably begin and end beyond the TDC and BDC. 8.2.1.1 Compression The cycle is started by drawing air at ambient conditions into the engine (Figure 8.4). This air is then compressed adiabatically by moving the piston upward in the cylinder from BDC to TDC (Figure 8.5). This compression raises the temperature of the air to a level where the fuel mixture, which is formed by injecting fuel once the air is compressed, spontaneously ignites. It is in this part of the cycle that work is applied to the air. This compression is considered to be isentropic. The ratio of the volume of the working fluid inducted into the cylinder before the compression process (v ) to its volume after the compression (v ) is defined as the volu- 1 2 metric compression ratio, r (5v /v ). c 1 2 8.2.1.2 Combustion (Figure 8.6) Next, the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber during the final stage of com- pression, thereby adding heat to the air by combustion of fuel. This process begins just as the piston leaves its TDC position. Because the piston is moving during this part of the cycle, the heat addition process is called isochoric (constant volume). The combustion process, however, takes place at constant pressure. 8.2.1.3 Expansion (Figure 8.7) In the Diesel cycle, fuel is burned to heat compressed air and as the rapidly burning mixture attempts to expand within the cylinder, it generates a high pressure that forces the piston downward from the TDC position to the BDC position in the cylinder.

Accordingly, the heat input (Q ), in heat output (Q ), and thermal efficiency (η ) can be calculated if the temperatures out th and specific heats of various end states are known.

This cycle is very similar to the Diesel cycle, except that the Otto cycle forms the basis of DieselPowerPlant 299 3 p 2 Constant Constant entropy entropy 4 1 α Swept volume V Figure8.8 P-vDiagramofOttocycle.Source:Fig.12.14,Page245,GasPowerCycles,[6]. a spark-ignition (S.I.) engine, which requires a spark to begin combustion of fuel. Figure 8.8 represents a P-V diagram of an Otto cycle. As in an ideal Diesel cycle four distinct processes are also followed in the Otto cycle: reversible adiabatic compression, addition of heat at constant volume, reversible adiabatic expansion, and rejection of heat at constant volume as follows: i. Air enters the cycle at point 1 when compression starts and it ends at point 2. The air is compressed in an isentropic process through a volume ratio v /v , 1 2 known as the compression ratio r (the ratio of the volume of the working fluid c before the compression process to its volume after). ii. Heat addition starts at point 2 and ends at point 3. A quantityof heat Q is added in at constant volume, and the working fluid temperature rises. iii. The isentropic expansion process starts at point 3 and it ends at point 4 to the original volume. iv. The heat Q is rejected at constant volume from point 4 to point 1. Air gets out cooled and the working fluid temperature goes down at a constant volume until the cycle is completed. Stages of above four processes are described below: 8.2.2.1 Compression In this part of the cycle as the piston moves from the TDC to the BDC, the inlet valve is open and the exhaust valve is closed. A fresh charge of fuel-air mixture is drawn into the cylinder (Figure 8.9). As the inlet valve closes the piston moves from the BDC upward to the TDC, and in the process compresses the fuel-air mixture (Figure 8.10). In this stroke work is contributed to the air. In an ideal Otto cycle, this compression is consideredtobeisentropic. 300 ThermalPowerPlant Air Piston fuel Figure8.9 InductionofairinOttocycle.Source:http://enx.org/resources/beb.

Combustion is initiated by a spark with the help of a spark plug, which is the most important and fundamental difference between the Otto cycle and the Diesel cycle. The piston during heat addition remains at a standstill and hence the process of heat addition is known as isochoric (constant volume). 8.2.2.3 Expansion (Figure 8.12) While tending to expand, the rapidly burning fuel-air mixture generates high pressure thus forcing the piston to travel downward from the TDC to the BDC in the cylin- der. It is in this stage that the cycle contributes its useful work, rotating the engine crankshaft. In an ideal Otto cycle this process is isentropic. In an engine, the cooling process involves exhausting the gas from the engine to the environment and replacing it with fresh air. Since this happens when the piston is at the TDC position in the cycle and remains immobile, this process is also isochoric (no change involume). 302 ThermalPowerPlant Figure8.12 ExpansioninOttocycle.Source:http://enx.org/resources/beb. 8.2.2.4 Thermal efficiency [5] The thermal efficiency of the Otto cycle can be expressed by dividing external work by heat input to the working fluid as follows: Q 1Q Q η 5 in out 511 out ð8:19Þ th Q Q in in Hence, considering the unit mass flow of the fluid and assuming constant specific heats for the air, for constant volume heating and cooling we can use C ðT 2T Þ T 2T η 511 v 1 4 512 4 1 ð8:20Þ th C ðT 2T Þ T 2T v 3 2 3 2 We know that for ideal gas Pv5nRT and γ5C /C and for adiabatic condition p v Pv γ5constant.

Once the power output is finalized the next step is to decide DieselPowerPlant 305 whether to select a two-stroke-cycle or a four-stroke-cycle diesel engine. Large, double- acting low-speed (80(cid:1)200rpm) power engines are the two-stroke type. A four-stroke- cycle should be preferred for lightweight, high-speed (1000(cid:1)2500rpm) engines. Medium-speed (200(cid:1)1000rpm) engines mayoperate on both cycles. The individual parts of a low-speed, two-stroke engines are comparatively heavy, while the parts of four-stroke engines are much lighter. Two-stroke engines are equipped with fewer cylinders"

Medium-speed (200(cid:1)1000rpm) engines mayoperate on both cycles. The individual parts of a low-speed, two-stroke engines are comparatively heavy, while the parts of four-stroke engines are much lighter. Two-stroke engines are equipped with fewer cylinders essentially there are less moving parts. Thus, mainte- nance cost of two-stroke engines is usually lower than that of medium or high speed engines. For the same output height of engine room of a four-stroke engine is lower than the height of engine room required by a two-stroke engine. The lubrication of the piston rings in four-stroke engines is better than that in two-stroke engines. The specific lubricating oil consumption of a two-stroke engine instead is lower than that of a four-stroke engine. Low-speed engines are generally built with horizontal cylinders. For higher speeds vertical cylinders are preferred. The rotational speed of the engine must always match the frequency of the grid for the power-generating station in all respects. Hence, the speed of the engine shall be calculated as follows: n560f=p ð8:28Þ where n5Rotational speed, rpm f5Frequencyof the grid, Hz p5Number of pair of poles Inacompressionignitionenginethepressureofcompressionmustbehighenough,typ- icallybetween11.5:1and22:1,toensureignitionatanyconditions.Theapproximatecom- pressionpressurerangesfrom2.8MPato4.8MPa.Ahighercompressionratioyieldshigher thermalefficiencyorhigherpoweroutput,butresultsinhigherstressonworkingparts. Another factor that influences the design is how many cylinders of the engine need to be considered. Once the number is known, the bore (d) and stroke (l) of the engine can be determined. The ratio of the stroke to the bore (l/d) generally varies between 0.9 and 1.9. Higher values of l/d up to as high as 2.5 or so may be chosen for opposed piston two-stroke engines. Knowing all the data as explained above the expected power output of the designed unit may be determined using Eq. 8.29: W 5plan=333:5 ð8:29Þ where W5Power output, kW p5Compression pressure, MPa 306 ThermalPowerPlant l5Stroke, m a5Inner cross-sectional area of the cylinder, cm2 n5Rotational speed, rpm Thereafter, it should be determined whether the expected output conforms to the desired output.

Fuel injection equipment ii. Piston iii. Governor iv. Starting system v. Intake silencer vi. Air filters vii. Exhaust mufflers viii. Supercharger 8.4.1 Fuel injection equipment Correct functioning of the fuel injection equipment begets efficient combustion in a Diesel engine. Fuel is injected through nozzles at adequate pressure for proper atomiza- tion of fuel. The nozzle area should be small enough to allow fuel intake for complete vaporization without remaining in suspension as droplets. Depending on the size of the engine the atomizing pressure developed by the fuel injection pump/s may vary from 40MPa to 100MPa."

Depending on the size of the engine the atomizing pressure developed by the fuel injection pump/s may vary from 40MPa to 100MPa. The atomized fuel thus obtained mixes with pressurized air in the correct proportion in the combustion chamber so that complete combustion is ensured. This equipment ensures supply of metered quantity of fuel. The fuel injection equip- ment also controls fuel-air mixing rate according to the required power output. This equipment needs to be designed with high standards to limit gaseous emissions, noise, and smoke in compliance with the local environmental regulations. 8.4.2 Piston In all internal combustion engines the design of a piston is very critical since it is the most vulnerable member. It is subjected to two prone attacks: one from the mechanical loading resulting from the maximum cylinder pressure and another thermal loading due to the heat of compression. Gas loads are transmitted to the crank shaft with the help of the piston. The design of a piston is influenced by the following parameters: i. Engine rating ii. Duty cycle DieselPowerPlant 307 iii. Quality of fuel iv. Maximum allowable weight, etc. The sealing of gas and oil in a cylinder is provided by piston rings. 8.4.3 Governor Like any rotary power-generating device every engine of a Diesel-generating plant is invariably provided with a governor to maintain the speed of the engine automatically by regulating the flow of fuel to meet the desired power output. A governor may be a hydro-mechanical or electronic type. 8.4.4 Starting system To start a Diesel engine from standstill sufficient torque to the crankshaft has to be pro- videdfromtheoutsidetorotatetheengineatthedesiredspeed,whichisessentiallydone byastartinggear.Themostcommonstartinggear isthemanualtype,e.g.,handcranking ora ropeandpulley system.It issimple, does not require an externalsource to break the startingtorque,anditscostsarelow.Theuseofmanualstartinggear,however,isrestricted to low-speed, small engines.

An air motoror a power cylinder is supplied with pressurized airfromanaircompressor,whichfacilitatesbreakingthestartingtorque. 8.4.5 Intake silencer When intake air from atmosphere rushes through the intake valve with high velocity it produces a hissing noise, which is intolerable to human ears. This noise is reduced by providing a silencer at the intake manifold. 8.4.6 Air filters A filter is installed at the air intake to prevent wear of pistons, piston rings, cylinder, valves, etc., by airborne suspended impurities. An air filter also assists in the attenua- tion of intake noise. 8.4.7 Exhaust mufflers When leaving the exhaust pipe exhaust gases produce an unbearable howling noise, which is much louder sound than intake noise.

Air intake Compressor Air filter By-pass valve Admission Electromagnetic clutch Escape Waste- gate Turbocompressor Depressurize valve Exhaust 8.4.8 Supercharger Supercharging of an engine can be defined as the artificial raising of the intake pres- sure of air above atmospheric pressure. The pressure is raised by the use of a compres- sor. If the compressor is driven by a turbine that operates on the exhaust gases from the engine it is called a turbocharger (Figure 8.14). The objectives of supercharging are to: 1. Increase the power output of the engine 2. Maintain the power output regardless of the altitude 3. Increase the air-fuel ratio, and thereby improve the thermal efficiencyof the engine 8.5 DIESEL ENGINE SYSTEMS For smooth trouble-free operation a Diesel engine is equipped with some or all of following systems. The necessity of each system is determined by the engine’s size, location of installation, and operating environment: i. Fuel Oil System ii. Lubricating Oil System iii. Cooling Water System iv. Compressed Air System v. Firefighting System Intercooler 308 ThermalPowerPlant Catalyst Figure 8.14 Turbocharging of an engine. Source: TURBOCHARGER, http://www.mechanical engineeringblog.com/tag/turbo-lag/. Oil tanker 8.5.1 Fuel oil system (Figure 8.15) The fuel oil used in a Diesel engine should be completely free from water and mechanical impurities. Solid and liquid contaminants are cleaned before use to prevent damage to fuel pumps and engine components. A diesel engine is capable of burning a wide range of low-quality liquid. It should be ensured that heating of fuel to the required viscosity is carried out without developing thermal cracking. For start-up of a diesel engine either high-speed diesel (HSD) or light diesel oil (LDO) is used. For normal running, a heavier grade fuel oil, e.g., heavy fuel oil (HFO) or low sulphur heavy stock (LSHS), is generally used. The fuel oil system deals with oil receipt, storage, treatment, and forwarding of oil to the Diesel engine. Fuel oil may be delivered to a plant by road tankers or railway wagons or if the plant is located near a port through the pipeline from the port. Oil delivered by road tankers or railway wagons is unloaded with the help of unloading pumps equipped with suction strainers. Connection is made"

Oil delivered by road tankers or railway wagons is unloaded with the help of unloading pumps equipped with suction strainers. Connection is made with the tankers or wagons through screwed hoses. Pressurized fuel oil from unloading pumps is supplied through the pipeline to bulk fuel oil storage tanks for storing. These storage tanks are usually vertical, cylindrical, cone-roof steel tanks. While storing heavy-grade fuel oil, the minimum temperature in bulk oil storage tanks should be maintained at around 353K by electric or steam heating to ensure the fluidity of the oil. However, for ensuring the required viscosityof heavy-grade fuel oil at the engine end the minimum temperature should be maintained in the treated oil storage tank at around 393K. esoh elbixelF DieselPowerPlant 309 Bulk fuel oil Treatment system storage tank Heater Treated fuel oil storage tank Pump Filter Fuel oil unloading Fuel feed pump Battery of pump centrifuges Diesel engine block Injectors of diesel engine Fine High pressure cylinder filter fuel injection pump Figure8.15 Fueloilsystem. 310 ThermalPowerPlant The fuel system of large diesel engines generally includes the following: i.

Low-pressure pipes The fuel feed pump supplies fuel from the treated oil storage tank/s and delivers it through a fine filter to the high-pressure fuel injection pumps. These pumps transfer oil to the injectors located on each cylinder. 8.5.2 Lubricating oil system (Figure 8.16) The lubricating oil system of a Diesel engine typically includes an external lube oil cir- cuit. The primary function of this circuit is to filter and cool the circulating oil. It also serves to heat, prime, and scavenge the oil when preparing the diesel engine for start- ing. An internal lube oil circuit supplies oil to individual units and parts of the diesel engine. The pipelines of internal circuit are inside the engine.

DieselPowerPlant 311 The external lube oil circuit in turn is typically divided into two groups, i.e., the main lube oil circuit and the auxiliary lube oil circuit. The main lube oil is either deliv- ered by road tankers with the help of lube oil unloading pumps or downloaded from drums containing lube oil to the Diesel engine main lube oil sump. A lube oil transfer pump delivers lube oil from the lube oil sump through a metal-in-oil detector, oil filter, and oil cooler into a circulating oil tank. When the pressure in the system exceeds the maximum limit a by-pass valve diverts part of the lube oil directly to the circulating tank. The temperature of the lube oil leaving the oil cooler is controlled by adjusting the flowof cooling water through the oil cooler automatically bya thermo-regulator. The temperature of the lube oil in the circulating oil tank is maintained with the help of an oil pump provided with oil heater, which cuts-in automatically in the event that the oil temperature drops down to 313K and cuts-out when the temperature rises above 323K. A lube oil separator is used to clean the oil circulating in the lubrication system. Oil is drawn by the separator pump, either from the system or from the tank, and after separation it is returned to the circulating tank. A temperature of 328K or more, as recommended, is maintained in this circuit, if required, with the help of an oil heater. Oil in the internal lube oil circuit is circulated with the help of an engine-driven internal lube oil pump. This pump draws oil from the circulating tank and delivers it to the engine through an oil filter. Prior to starting the Diesel engine it is primed with oil by the priming pump. The internal circuit is exclusively used for “piston cooling and lubrication of crosshead and crankpin bearing” and “lubrication of camshaft main bearings.” Oil is drained from the pistons and bearings into the Diesel engine sump, from which the scavenge pump takes its suction and delivers oil back to the circulating tank. Separate lube oil pipelines connect to various lubricating points of major and minor accessories, drives, and the turbo-charger. 8.5.3 Cooling water system (Figure 8.17) The Diesel engine cooling system generally consists of two circuits: the internal cooling circuit, also known as jacket cooling system, and the external cooling circuit. The water circulating along the internal circuit cools the Diesel engine, while the water of the external circuit serves to cool the oil, the water of the internal cooling circuit and the air for supercharging.

The water circulating along the internal circuit cools the Diesel engine, while the water of the external circuit serves to cool the oil, the water of the internal cooling circuit and the air for supercharging. Distilled or de-mineralized water treated with a corrosion inhibitor is generally used in the inner circuit, while either raw water or filtered water is adopted in the external circuit. The inner circuit cooling water pump takes water from the Diesel engine sump and circulates water through the engine jacket, jacket water cooler, and the turbo- compressor. From the supply manifolds, water also flows to cool the exhaust manifold sections and the working cylinders. The water from the working cylinders is drained Heater Water circulating pump Inner circuit cooling water pump to return manifolds, from which it is directed to the pump suction line, completing the cycle. An expansion tank is connected to the suction side of the pump to ensure initial priming, as well as to ensure reliable functioning of the closed system when the water volume changes due to heating or leakage. An independent water-circulating pump is provided with an electric heater to warm up the engine with hot water, par- ticularly when the engine remains idle. The heater automatically cuts-in when the engine water outlet temperature falls below about 303K and cuts-out when the tem- perature exceeds 323K. The external cooling circuit is equipped with an outer circuit cooling water pump. This pump draws water from an evaporative mechanical-draft cooling tower sump and directs it through the lube oil cooler and internal cooling circuit water cooler and then returns to the cooling tower with the help of a water transfer pump. Cooling water from this circuit is supplied to air coolers, generator-bearing cooler, and compressor cooling system as well. The amount of water passing through the lube oil cooler is usually determined by a thermo-regulator control unit, to maintain the operating temperature of the oil flowing out of the cooler. For small capacity engines, the inner circuit cooling water may be cooled by supplying air to a radiator with cooling air fans. enigne morF enigne oT Make-up water Expansion tank Outer circuit cooling water pump From engine Air cooler Diesel engine Air cooler retaw dloC gnilooc morf rewot retaw mraW gnilooc ot rewot 312 ThermalPowerPlant Water transfer pump Oil Oil Oil Legend cooler Inner circuit Outer circuit To compressor cooler To generator Water bearing cooling cooler Figure8.17 Coolingwatersystem.

During start-up, pressurized air enters the Diesel engine main starting pipeline through the main starting valves to serve bank of cylinders. From the main starting valves air gets into the air distributors as well as into working cylinder-starting valves. Once the diesel engine starts operating on fuel, the starting valve is closed to cut the supplyof air. From the starting air receivers control air is led off through pressure-reducing valve to the oil and water thermo-regulators. This air then regulates the flow of water through the cooler or heat-exchanger byopening or closing the valves. 8.5.5 Firefighting system In a Diesel power station fire may start accidentally due to short circuiting, ignition of fuel and lubricants or of common combustible materials, e.g., paper, cotton waste, etc. As soon as minor fires are detected portable/semi-portable fire extinguishers are used to extinguish it. Oil fire is best tackled by a foam-type extinguisher along with a spray water sys- tem. The foam provides a blanket over the oil surface and cuts off the oxygen supply, which is essential for supporting combustion. As an alternative means, sand stored in the bins near the dyke walls of fuel storage tanks can also be used to prevent outbreak of minor fire. Sand is sprinkled evenly on the spillage surfaces using shovels/buckets. Small fires can be handled successfully using sand. Ordinary water is not generally suitable for fighting oil fire, since oil has a tendency to float and spread further. Electrical fire is fought with carbon dioxide fire extinguishers. Wherever practical, the electric supply to the equipment on fire should be switched off before using the extinguisher. In general, fire due to combustible materials such as cotton waste, paper, timber, etc., is tackled either by soda-acid type fire extinguishers or with water stored in fire buckets. In the event of a big fire, portable/semi-portable extinguishers may not extinguish the fire effectively. In such an event, the central firefighting team should be called as soon as possible. 8.6 PROBLEMS 8.1 In an ideal air standard Diesel engine, 1kg of air is taken from atmosphere at a pressure of 101.3kPa and temperature of 288K.

CHAPTER 9 Steam Power Plant Systems 9.1 INTRODUCTION A large pulverized coal-fired steam power plant encompasses numerous systems, both complex and simple, the details of which are difficult to present in one chapter. Nevertheless, systems that are complex in nature and constitute major area of steam power plant are addressed in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 as follows. The primary objective of this chapter is to illustrate just how vast and complex a large power plant is. Against this backdrop the materials presented in the following sections are aimed at helping power plant engineers execute their respective area of responsibilities, be it design or field engineering services. However, this chapter refrains from describing individual equipment,"

Against this backdrop the materials presented in the following sections are aimed at helping power plant engineers execute their respective area of responsibilities, be it design or field engineering services. However, this chapter refrains from describing individual equipment, which is difficult to be covered in one book, let alone a single chapter. In any project or industry, or even for a reasonably comfortable life, the first utility that is essential is “water” followed by “electrical power.” In accordance with this phi- losophy this chapter first discussed the “intake/raw water” system followed by other mechanical systems. A general discussion on electrical power supply and distribution systems is presented in the concluding part of this chapter. 9.2 MECHANICAL SYSTEMS In general, all mechanical systems consist of the following components: i. Piping ii. Hangers and/or supports iii. Isolating valves, check valves, relief valves iv. Pressure/temperature/level/flow measurement and control In addition to the above, based on its complexity a system may comprise pump/fan/ compressor, cooler, filter/strainer, storage tank/reservoir, control valve, flow elements, etc.Allthesecomponents,however,arenotindividuallydiscussedinfollowingsections. It is also to be noted that mechanical systems (Table 9.1) which have been dis- cussed in some of the previous chapters are not repeated in this chapter. 9.2.1 Intake/raw water (RW) system (Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.2) This system begins with the intake pump house, where the intake pumps are located. This pump house is situated on either a riverbank or canal-bank or sea coast. Water ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

From the forebay each intake pump receives its suction and then discharges rawwatertoeither rawwaterstoragetankor rawwater reservoirforstoring. Depending on the configuration of the plant water storage and supply system, raw water from this storage tank or reservoir may be distributed as service water to differ- ent users, i.e., fire-water storage tank, as make-up to cooling tower, or water pre-treatment plant for clarification and further treatment of water. 9.2.2 Water pre-treatment system All natural water, commonly known in the industry as raw water, contains impurities. The quantum and type of impurities depend on the source of this natural water. If the source is well water the pre-treatment plant would likely constitute filtration of the water. However, if raw water is sourced from an open area, e.g., cooling pond, reservoir, lake, river, sea, etc., the pre-treatment system would need to be more complex. Use of untreated raw water for industrial application may result in equipment/ system fouling, unscheduled down time, and loss of production and waste of energy. Hence, prior to using this water it must be pre-treated, lest raw water will seriously affect the efficient and reliable operation of equipment cooling system and steam generating systems. The water pre-treatment plant includes two sections: one section meets the clari- fied and filtered water requirements for the circulating (condenser cooling) water, ser- vice water, drinking water, etc., and another section serves as the clarified and filtered water input to the de-mineralized (DM) water plant. In a clarified water reservoir sodium hypochlorite solution is dosed to prevent any micro-biological growth. The first step in the water pre-treatment process is “clarifica- tion,”theprincipalmechanismsofwhicharecoagulation,flocculation,andsedimentation. Coagulation is the process of destabilizing suspended particles in raw water by neu- tralizing their charge. It is carried out in a rapid mixing tank to ensure complete and uniform dispersion of the coagulant throughout the entire mass of water. The reten- tion time for this process may vary from 30(cid:1)300s. To ensure the desired effect of the process of coagulation sometimes chemicals, such as alum (aluminum sulfate), ferrous sulfate, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride, activated"

To ensure the desired effect of the process of coagulation sometimes chemicals, such as alum (aluminum sulfate), ferrous sulfate, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride, activated silica, organic polyelectrolytes, etc., are dozed. Flocculation is the process of agglomerating destabilized particles, and is carried out by gentle stirring of water in the flocculation tank. The detention time may vary from 600(cid:1)3600s. Once the water is coagulated and flocculated the next step is the process of liquid- solid separation followed by settling of solid particles at the bottom of a tank. This SteamPowerPlantSystems 319 Sodium hypochlorite Polyelectrolite Alum Lime Clarified water reservoir Raw water Figure9.3 Clariflocculatorwithclarifiedwaterreservoir. process is known as sedimentation. The tank is normally provided with mechanical sludge rakes/collector arms to scrap the sludge from the bottom of the tank. Figure 9.3 shows how alum and lime are added to raw water in a rapid mixing tank, either a clariflocculator or a combination of flash mixer and inclined surface set- tler, to facilitate coagulation. While alum is added for settling of particles in the form of clusters, lime is added to remove the hardness (caused by the presence of calcium and magnesium salts) of raw water by the precipitation of calcium carbonate and mag- nesium hydroxide. A polyelectrolite solution may be dozed to raw water to reduce the level of colloidal silica, if there is any. The clarified water is then supplied to the softening plant for abatement of residual hardness and alkalinity (resulting from mainly bicarbonates), which have a detrimental effect on steam generators, pipelines, heat exchangers, etc. To remove organic matter present in raw water, chlorine is dozed in that section of the clarified water that is dedicated for DM water service. Clarified water used for service water, dust suppres- sion, etc., requires no further treatment. 9.2.3 Water softening system If the hardness of the clarified water coming out of the pre-treatment plant is too excessive to use in condenser cooling water system, the clarified water will need to be passed through ion-exchange polishing units to reduce the hardness to a level not exceeding 5.0ppm as CaCO . In an ion-exchange softener, sodium ions from solid 3 phase are exchanged with calcium and magnesium ions from aqueous phase, thereby producing soft water.

The common feature of each methodissomeformofion-exchangeprocess,i.e.,displacementofoneionbyanother. DMwatercomingoutofthetreatmentplantisstoredinDMwaterstoragetank. Raw water, irrespective of its source, contains many minerals, as cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions), in diverse concentrations, along with silica (SiO ) and free carbon dioxide (CO ). Cations in raw water are usually cal- 2 2 cium, magnesium, barium, aluminum, iron, sodium, and potassium. Anions generally are chlorides, sulphates, nitrates, carbonates, and bicarbonates. In an ion-exchange process, cations are replaced with hydrogen ions in a cation- exchanger and anions are replaced with hydroxide ions in an anion-exchanger. Resins generally used in an ion-exchange process are weak acid cation resin, strong acid cat- ion resin, weak-base anion resin, and strong-base anion resin. The amount of resins needed in a plant depends on the qualityof incoming water. A weak acid cation unit exchanges cations of mainly alkaline salts (carbonates, bicarbonates of Na, K). If the cation content constituting bicarbonates is significant, the incoming clarified water is first passed through a weak acid cation unit. If the incoming clarified water contains cations of both neutral salts (chlorides, sulphates, nitrates of Ca, Mg, and Na) and alkaline salts they are exchanged with the hydrogen ions of the resin of a strong acid cation-exchanger. The effluent of strong acid cation- exchanger is usually called “decationized water.” This water then enters the degasser SteamPowerPlantSystems 321 tower where CO is removed by scrubbing with an upward flow of air. The outgoing 2 effluent from the degasser tower is called “decationized and decarbonated” water. The use of a strong-base anion-unit exchanger is required in the event that incom- ing clarified water contains anions of"

The outgoing 2 effluent from the degasser tower is called “decationized and decarbonated” water. The use of a strong-base anion-unit exchanger is required in the event that incom- ing clarified water contains anions of both strong and weak acids, e.g., hydrochloric, sulphuric, nitric, carbonic, and silicic, to exchange them with free-to-move hydroxide ions of the resin. In plantswhere freemineral anionic content of clarified waterconsti- tutes a large amount of the total anionic content then the incoming decationized and decarbonated water is first passed through a weak-base anion-exchanger.

These remaining impurities arethenpolishedinamixedbedunitwherebothcationandanionresinsaremixed. In general, various vessels, which contained chemicals and resins used for DM water production, comprise pressure sand filter (PSF), activated carbon filter (ACF), weak acid cation unit (WAC), strong acid cation unit (SAC), degasser, weak-base anion unit (WBA), strong-base anion unit (SBA), and mixed bed unit (MB). Figure 9.4 shows the arrangement of various vessels, without WAC and WBA units. Water enters each vessel at the top, flows downward through the filter media/resin bed, and then flows out of the bottom of each vessel. Clarified PSF ACF SAC SBA MB water Chlorine Degasser tower DM water storage tank Degassed water storage tank Degasser air blower Figure9.4 FlowdiagramofDMwatersystem. 322 ThermalPowerPlant In the pressure sand filter (PSF) turbidity of incoming water is reduced. PSF is followed by the activated carbon filter (ACF), where suspended impurities and organic matters are entrapped and “free chlorine” and “free iron” are removed. Flow of water is downward as explained above. Once all available ions in an ion-exchanger become saturated and exhausted by repeated exchange of ions, the exchanger is regenerated. Regeneration of SAC (and also WAC, if provided) is carried out with HCl, whereas SBA (and also WBA, if pro- vided) is regenerated with NaOH. The process of regeneration is classified as co- current when chemicals (HCl, NaOH) are dozed along with the flow of water or counter-current when chemicals are dozed in the reverse direction of flow of water. Figures 9.5 and 9.6 depict the condition of the resin bed of a typical strong acid cation-exchanger before and after co-current regeneration. The condition of the resin bed of a typical strong-base anion-exchanger before and after co-current regeneration is shown in Figures 9.7 and 9.8.

In plants where the requirement of DM water is not substantial, the treatment of clarified water uses an electrical de-ionization unit (EDI) based on membrane tech- nology. The EDI process removes ionizable species from liquids using electrically active media, where an electrical potential influences ion transport. These units ensure continuous water purification without regeneration of chemicals. 324 ThermalPowerPlant Hydroxide Sulfate Carbonate Nitrate Chloride Slica Strong base anion exchanger Figure9.8 ResinbedofSBAafterco-currentregeneration. EDI-based plants comprise cation-exchange membranes, anion exchange mem- branes, spacers, electrodes, and cation/anion exchange resin. The primary cation/ anion exchange process is replaced with a reverse osmosis (RO) process. It is the initial demineralization step that removes ionic impurities, particles, and high molecular weight organics. EDI replaces the mixed bed ion-exchanger. It is the final deminerali- zation step that removes residual ionic and ionizable impurities. 9.2.5 Auxiliary cooling water (ACW) system (Figure 9.9) The auxiliary cooling water system uses clarified water in a common sump, catering to both auxiliary cooling water (ACW) and circulating (condenser cooling) water (CW) systems. Each of the ACW pumps is provided with a dedicated bay in this sump. These pumps receive suction from the common sump and supply cooling water to turbine lube oil coolers, heat exchangers of the closed cycle cooling water (CCCW) system, and as make-up to the ash water system, etc. Hot water returns from the coolers then flows to the CW system return line, which in turn flows to the hot water section of the cooling tower.

The CW system could be either a “recirculating” type or a “once through” type. In the “recirculating” type (Figure 9.9),"

The CW system could be either a “recirculating” type or a “once through” type. In the “recirculating” type (Figure 9.9), the clarified water reservoir is the source of water. From this reservoir, water is pumped to the ACW and CW sump. This sump comprises a dedicated bay for each CW pump, which supplies cooling water to the condenser. Hot water from the condenser outlets is then carried to the hot water section of the cooling tower, where the downward flow of water is cooled by the upward flow of air, thereby rejecting heat to the atmosphere. The cooling tower may be the “induced draft” type or the “natural draft” type. Cooled water is collected at the cold-water basin of the cooling tower. From the cold-water basin water travels to the ACWand CW sump. Since the cooling water travels through a closed cycle, only the make-up water is replenished from the clari- fied water reservoir to the ACWand CW sump. The “once through” condenser cooling water system (Figure 9.10) can only be adopted in coastal areas. In this type of water system sea is the source of water. Circulating water (CW) pumps are installed near or on the coast, from which water is pumped through CW piping. The hot water from the condenser is returned to 326 ThermalPowerPlant CCOoNndDeEnNseSrER CW pump SSEEAA Figure9.10 OncethroughtypeCWsystem. the sea downstream of CW pump house, such that the maximum temperature difference between the supply water and the return water is restricted to 7K, to protect marine life. In both the “recirculating” type and “once through” type, cooling water enters the water box of the condenser at the bottom and subsequently flows through the tubes of the condenser. The cooling water absorbs the latent heat of the exhaust steam that passes over the outside of the tubes, causing steam to condense. Avacuum is thus created in the condenser by condensation of the exhaust steam. The condensed steam or the condensate is then directed to the condenser hotwell and warm circulating water exits through the condenser water box outlet at the top. With this configuration the CW flow through each shell of the condenser and the pressure (vacuum) in each shell would be identical, since the CW inlet temperature in each shell remains unchanged. This condenser is called a “single-pressure” condenser. In addition to the above, there is another configuration where cooling water enters into one shell only, say shell 1 of the condenser, passes through the tubes of this shell and then exits through outlet water"

In addition to the above, there is another configuration where cooling water enters into one shell only, say shell 1 of the condenser, passes through the tubes of this shell and then exits through outlet water box. The outlet cooling water from shell 1, at a higher temperature than its inlet temperature, enters shell 2 as “cold water,” then passes through the tubes of this shell and comes out through condenser outlets (Figure 9.11). With the new configuration of CW flow, the pressure in shell 1 would be less than the pressure in shell 2 because of dissimilar “cold water” inlet temperatures. Thus, the nomenclature given to this condenser is “multi-pressure” condenser. The net result of the new configuration of CW flow is always a lower average back-pressure for the multi-pressure condenser compared to that obtained with the SteamPowerPlantSystems 327 2 1 CW out CW in Figure9.11 Flowschemeofmulti-pressurecondenser. same water flow and surface in a conventional single-pressure condenser. A multi- pressure condenser would hence yield the following benefits: i. With lower average back-pressure, the turbine heat rate will improve. ii. If the average back-pressure of multi-pressure condenser is selected same as a single-pressure condenser, the turbine heat rate will remain unchanged, but the surface area and cooling water flow will be less. Thus, capital expenditure and running cost will be reduced. 9.2.7 Closed cycle cooling water (CCCW) system (Figure 9.12) The source of water for a closed cycle cooling water (CCCW) system is DM water storage tank, from which water is transferred through a pump to an overhead CCCW make-up or expansion tank. This tank is atmospheric and is located at a height above the CCCW pump suction line to provide make-up to the system and also to act as a surge for expansion of the fluid in circulation due to temperature changes. The tank level is maintained by a supplyof DM water. CCCW system supplies DM cooling water through heat exchangers to various coolers of the steam generator (SG) package, turbo-generator (TG) package, compres- sors, ash-handling system, sample coolers, etc., with the help of CCCW pumps. Hot- water return from these coolers then flows back to the suction of pumps, the discharge from which flows through the heat exchangers. In these exchangers, water is cooled by rejecting heat to the auxiliary cooling water. Caustic soda (NaOH) or morpholine may be dozed in a CCCW pump suction header for maintaining a pH between 8 and 9. Oxygen, which may enter into closed circuit, is scavenged by intermittent dosing of hydrazine to the system. 9.2.8 Compressed air system (Figure 9.13) Compressed air (CA) system comprises two sections;"

The entire fire-water network is kept pressurized by one hydro-pneumatic tank, and pressure in this tank in turn is maintained by an air compressor. In the event that there is a fall in the water level in the hydro-pneumatic tank it is replenished with the help of a jockey pump. The hydrant system essentially consists of a large network of piping, which feeds pressurized water to a number of hydrant valves located throughout the entire power station. In the event of a fire, fire hoses are coupled to hydrant valves, and jets of water are then directed toward the fire.

Before leaving the steam generator steam is passed through super- heaters to reach the superheat state and through attemperators, where the main steam temperature is maintained by spray water. Steam thus generated is known as the main steam and is sent from a steam generator superheater outlet to the high-pressure (HP) turbine inlet. The steam then expands through the HP turbine to carry out mechani- cal work. The exhaust steam from HP turbine is known as cold reheat steam, which is sent back to the steam generator in reheater section, where it is again superheated.

The reheated steam, known as hot reheat steam, is directed from the steam generator to the intermediate-pressure (IP) turbine. This steam expands in IP and low-pressure (LP) turbines to carry out additional mechanical work and then exhausts into the condenser, where exhaust steam is condensed and condensate is collected in the hotwell. 9.2.11 HP/LP bypass system (Figure 9.15) A high-pressure/low-pressure (HP/LP) turbine bypass system is used to facilitate fast start-up and to allow quick reloadingof theunitfollowing aturbinetrip.TheHPbypass systemtakessteamfromthemainsteamline,upstreamoftheHPturbineinletemergency stop valves (ESVs), and discharges it to the cold reheat line through a pressure reducing valve and a de-superheater.

It is imperative that the process of warming-up thus discussed is completed prior to turbine start-up. The steam drain system also prevents accumulation of water in the pipelines at start-up and under all operating conditions. Drains from this system are transferred to the condenser.

(For detailed treatment on Regenerative Rankine cycle refer to Chapter 1, Steam Power Plant Cycles.) The extraction steam system receives steam from the cold reheat header and IP and LP turbines. In very large steam turbines, in general, with a unit capacity of 800MW or higher, the extraction point is also provided in the HP turbine. The extraction steam system has two distinct sections: the high-pressure (HP) section and the low-pressure (LP) section. In the HP section steam is extracted from the cold reheat line and IP turbine to pre-heat the feedwater, while the LP section uses extrac- tion steam from the IP turbine exhaust and LP turbine to pre-heat the condensate. Each extraction steam line is provided with one power-assisted non-return valve (NRV) and a motorized isolation valve (Figure 9.18). The extraction line to the deaerating heater also contains one additional power assisted non-return valve (Figure 9.19). In the event of a high level in any of these heaters the non-return valve and isolation valve should close automatically. The non-return valve also provides automatic protection against reverse flow on rapid load reduction or in the event of turbine trip.

In the event that next lower-pressure heater is not available or the level in the heater under consideration reaches a high level, the drain from the affected HP heater should be diverted to the deaerating heater and the drain from the affected LP heater diverted to the condenser.

HP turbine into the turbine under vacuum. While the leakage of steam causes a reduction in cycle efficiency, entryof cold air may cause thermal shock to hot turbine internals. All turbine glands are continuously sealed by steam from the turbine gland steam header. During normal operation, leak-off steam tapped from different sections in the pressure-side stages of turbine glands is used to seal the glands of low-pressure stages. Airside leakage is cooled in the gland steam cooler/condenser, and the condensate is drained to the condenser hotwell. Pressure in the turbine gland sealing system is main- tained at slightly above atmospheric pressure. 9.2.17 Condenser air evacuation system The Carnot cycle proved that in the steam-water cycle the lower the heat sink tem- perature the higher the cycle efficiency. This means the condenser pressure should be as low as possible. The condenser pressure is lowered to sub-atmospheric condition by evacuating air from the condenser shell as well as from the internal area of the con- nected LP turbine.

Either of these vacuum-creating devices sucks air from the condenser shell and discharges it to the atmosphere. Steam to the ejector is supplied from the auxiliary steam header during all modes of operation. Condensed steam from the ejector is recycled back to the condensate system. Prior to starting a steam turbine it is best to evacuate the LP turbine and con- denser rapidly to reduce the condenser pressure from atmospheric to a lower value. This is achieved by using either a non-condensing type single-stage starting air ejector or a vacuum pump. The Heat Exchange Institute (HEI) recommends that for the evacuation of air from atmospheric pressure to 33.86kPa absolute pressure Hg in about 1800s the capacity of the evacuating equipment should be as given in Table 9.2.

The main condensate is collected in the hotwell, which is then pumped by condensate extrac- tion pumps (CEP) to the deaerator through steam jet-air ejectors (not required if the vacuum pump is used), gland steam condenser, and LP feedwater heaters, where condensate is successively heated by extraction steam. During this process, the steam condensate collected from different heaters/coolers in the cycle joins the main con- densate flow, is heated in the low-pressure heaters, and is finally stored in the feed- water storage tank of the deaerating heater or deaerator (Figure 9.22). A common minimum flow recirculation line (in large plants each CEP may be provided with a dedicated recirculation line) is provided downstream of gland steam condenser to the hotwell to protect the running pump/s in the event that throughput to deaerating heater falls below a minimum flow limit.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) in condensate downstream of the hotwell should not exceed 15ppb (parts per billion) or 15µg/kg. In the case of fluctuation in the cycle, condensate will be transferred to and from a condensate water storage tank as required. The level in the hotwell is maintained by adding make-up water to the condenser or dumping condensate from the condensate cycle. Normally, in the event of a low level in the hotwell condensate water will flow from the storage tank to the hotwell by the static head. If this supply fails to restore the level an emergency supply through a pump will be cut-in. Once the level becomes high in the hotwell the condensate will be dumped to the storage tank. Regarding the minimum hotwell storage capacity, the HEI recommends, “....vol- ume sufficient to contain all of the condensate produced in the condenser in a period of 60s under conditions of design steam load.” Nevertheless, common industry practice for sizing of the condenser hotwell in many countries, which is also followed by Central Electricity Authority"

Dissolved oxygen in feedwater downstream of deaerating heater should not exceed 5ml/l or 7ppb (parts per billion) or 7µg/kg. The feedwater storage tank capacity as recommended by the HEI should be “...600s to overflow as determined by the manufacturer’s design criteria.” The over- flow level is also defined by the HEI “...shall not be closer to the top of the vessel than 85% of the tank diameter.” The usual industry practice in many countries including recommendation of the CEA, however, is: “the feedwater storage tank capacity (between normal level and low-low level) shall be 360s of BMCR with a filling factor of 0.66.

This system also sends water to the boiler superheater attemperators, reheater attemperators, auxiliary steam de-superheaters, HP/LP Bypass de-superheaters, etc. Under normal operating conditions, feedwater flows from the deaerator feed stor- age tank, which is the beginning of the feedwater system, to the suction of boiler feed pumps (BFP).

The chemical feed system has two distinct units: a LP dozing system and a HP dozing system. In LP dozing system ammonia/morpholine and hydrazine are used. Ammonia/ morpholine is injected into the condensate supply header to maintain a pH of the condensate between 9.0 and 9.3 to inhibit corrosion. Hydrazine is injected at the boiler feed pump suction line for scavenging of oxygen and for secondary pH control. The presence of oxygen leads to corrosion of boiler internal surfaces. The consequent effect of dissolved oxygen in condensate and feedwater is pitting of internal surfaces. Hydrazine, in conjunction with mechanical facilities of feedwater deaeration, controls the chemistry of water and steam in the power cycle. Morpholine is also introduced in the make-up line to the hotwell to maintain the pH of water. Analyses of treated qualityof condensate and feedwater are given in Table 9.3 and Table 9.4, respectively.

In the presence of phosphate ions (PO ) and at high tem- 4 perature and pH, these calcium and magnesium salts become soft, loosely adhering scales, which are removed by boiler water blow-down. Analysis of treated quality of superheated steam is presented in Table 9.5. 9.2.21 Generator hydrogen cooling system Each side of the generator enclosure is provided with stator end shields to keep the enclosure gas-tight. When the machine is running heat is generated within the gener- ator enclosure. Some cooling medium needs to be circulated through the generator stator and rotor to dissipate the heat and prevent an increase in conductor temperature to within a permissible limit. In small-sized generators this cooling medium is air. This air is circulated by axial fans installed on both sides of the rotor shaft ends. The air flows through the rotor conductors, exits radially, and mixes with fresh cold air. The mixed air then cools the stator core (Figure 9.23), and the hot air in turn is cooled by circulating cooling water. Astheunitsizeincreasesanair-cooledgeneratorbecomeshuge.Torestrictthesizeof the generator hydrogen gas in lieu of air is used as the cooling agent principally because the density of hydrogen is 1/14th the density of air at a given pressure and temperature andthe thermal conductivityof hydrogen is almost 7 times that of air. The combination of these two benefits permits a reduction of about 20% in the amount of active material ofageneratorforagivenoutputandagiventemperatureriseofwindings. The pressure of hydrogen is normally maintained between 0.2(cid:1)0.4MPa, but could be raised to 0.6MPa. The purityof hydrogen for circulation has to be 99.7% or better; otherwise it could be explosive. In a typical design an axial-flow fan circulates hydrogen within the generator (Figure 9.24). The fan draws hot gas from one end, passes it through coolers, and then cooled gas is passed over the rotor winding, stator core, and stator end winding space. Hydrogen"

DM water or distilled water may be used as the coolant. The dis- solved oxygen content of the coolant must not be more than 80ppb (µg/l) and the pH of the coolant should be maintained between 8.0 and 8.5 by dozing chemicals, otherwise copper corrosion could result. DM water is supplied to the stator cooling water tank, from which a pump drawing water passes it through the cooler and filter and then supplies the water to stator conductors. The return from the conductors is drained to the stator cooling water tank. 344 ThermalPowerPlant Waste gas to Stator cooling water tank atmosphere Pump Cooler Filter Figure9.25 Generatorstatorcoolingwatersystem. 9.2.23 Generator seal oil system As discussed in Section 9.2.21 the rotor winding of large generators is generally cooled by hydrogen, hence hydrogen may escape through shaft seals where the rotor comes out of the enclosure even though each side of the generator enclosure is gas- tight. To prevent such leakage of hydrogen a continuous film of oil is maintained between the rotor and stationary seal rings. Seal oil also prevents entry of air into hydrogen-cooled enclosure. The pressure of seal oil on both air side and hydrogen side is maintained slightly higher than the hydrogen pressure (Figure 9.26) to restrict entryof hydrogen and air through seal rings on either side. Figure 9.27 shows a simplified seal oil flow diagram that comprises two separate seal oil circuits, i.e., air-side seal oil circuit and hydrogen-side seal oil circuit. One seal oil pump receives suction from the seal oil storage tank and supplies oil to the air-side shaft seals through the cooler and filter.

The main purpose of the fuel oil system is to facilitate the start-up of boiler, since pulverized coal on its own is unable to ignite and requires ignition energy from an external source. Fuel oil is required for flame stabilization at low-load (usually between 30% and 40% BMCR) operation with pulverized coal. The system is also capable of ensuring low-load (up to about 30% BMCR) operation of boiler without coal firing.

A return line, from the fuel oil header supplying to the burners, is provided to route excess oil back to the oil tank and also to maintain hot oil circulation up to the boiler front for use in burners in the case of emergency. The HFO supply and return lines are insulated and either steam traced or electric traced to keep the lines warm at all times. Similarly, pumps and strainers are steam/electric jacketed. 9.2.25 Coal-handling system (CHS) (Figure 9.29) Coal is the primary fuel of a pulverized fuel-fired boiler. Coal is received either at the track hopper area or at the wagon tippler complex by railway wagons. The track hop- per is provided with in-motion weighbridges, while the rotary type wagon tipplers are provided with integral type weighbridges. For unloading and feeding the coal to the bunker, conveyors are arranged along with crushers, transfer points, etc. Conveyors are provided with rollers, idlers, and in-line-magnetic-separators to remove any tramp iron in the coal. For the purpose of unloading coal from railway wagons coal is collected either at track hoppers or at wagon tippler hoppers. The coal unloaded in hoppers is sent to to coal crusher via conveyors. From the crusher coal is taken to the crushed-coal storage area through another conveyor system. From this storage area coal is reclaimed by either bulldozers and/or stacker-reclaimers and transferred to powerhouse terminal hopper, from which the coal is fed to each coal bunker of the"

SteamPowerPlantSystems 349 From the coal bunkers coal is fed to the pulverizers through raw coal feeders. Pulverized coal from each pulverizer is carried by hot primary air and is fed to the coal burners of the boiler. Secondary air is then supplied near the burners for complete combustion of pulverized coal. (For more details on the pulverized coal- fired system see Chapter 4.) For improving operating conditions in the coal-handling area, a separate arrangement is provided for dust extraction, dust suppression, and ventilation. 9.2.26 Ash-handling system (AHS) In large steam generators using low-grade coal, with 33(cid:1)45% ash content, collection and disposal of ash poses a serious problem. In a typical 500MW coal-fired unit pro- duction of ash per diem varies from about 3.03106kg to about 5.03106kg, depending on the qualityof these low-grade coals. Coal ash may be broadly classified into three parts. The heaviest part, clinker, is collected at the furnace bottom at the bottom ash hopper. The remainder is carried away by flue gas, of which coarser ash in grit form is collected in economizer hoppers and air pre-heater hoppers. Finer ash in powdered form is further carried away by flue gas to either electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and/or bag filter, where ash is sepa- rated from flue gas and collected in hoppers. Ash collected at the bottom of the furnace is called bottom ash (BA) and constitutes about 15(cid:1)20% of total ash generated, but at times could be as low as 10%. The bal- ance, 80(cid:1)85% of the total ash generated, is called fly ash (FA), of which around 5% is coarse ash. The function of the ash-handling system is to remove ash collected at various hop- pers, as described above, and to dispose it conveniently to an allocated disposal area away from the main powerhouse. While collection and disposal of bottom ash and coarse ash is normally continuous, that of fly ash is carried out periodically and sequentially. In earlier days, the ash-handling system used to be the wet type. Today, plants use “zero leakage systems” to comply with environmental protection regulations, which usually means dry ash-handling systems.

In a wet ash disposal system the bottom ash is collected in water-impounded hoppers located just below the boiler furnace and then is removed by jet pump/eductors/hydro-ejectors (Figure 9.30). Coarse ash and fly ash in wet ash-handling are collected either by wetting water jets or by a hydro-pneumatic system. All the slurry ash is then taken to an ash slurry sump, from which this slurry is pumped into an ash pond for disposal. In a dry ash-handling system bottom ash and coarse ash are continuously dis- posed of through a metallic conveyor located beneath the boiler and typically trans- ported to an intermediate bottom ash silo. This metallic conveyor normally moves 350 ThermalPowerPlant Normal water High water level Mean ash level level Jetting nozzle Clinker grinder Sluice gate Weir box High pressure Jet pump/ and access door water inlet eductor Figure9.30 Wetbottomash-handlingsystem.

This allows cooling of bottom ash prior to its disposal to the silo. Discharge from the bottom ash silo is sent pneumatically to the final bottom ash silo (Figure 9.31) for onward disposal through road tankers, trucks, etc. The bottom ash hopper is provided with gates. In the event that the metallic conveyor is under maintenance, evacuation of the bottom ash is isolated with the help of these gates. Dry fly ash collected from the ESP/bag filter hoppers is transported pneumatically to a remote silo via an intermediate surge hopper. From the remote silo fly ash is dis- posed of through road tankers, trucks, etc. SteamPowerPlantSystems 351 Whenever disposal through trucks/tankers fails an emergency dense phase slurry disposal system, known as high concentration slurry disposal (HCSD) system, acts as a backup. In this system ash from the remote silos is discharged to a tank, mixed with water to form dense slurry. Slurry from this tank is disposed of continuously to an ash disposal area through HCSD pumps. 9.2.27 Steam water analysis system (SWAS) As noted in the discussion on chemical feed system in order to reduce problems of scale and corrosion in the boiler, feedwater, and condensate systems, chemicals need to be dozed into the plant steam/water cycle.

To quantify the amount of particular chemical to be dozed it is essential to monitor the chemistry of the steam/water. Chemical analyzers are usually installed in a central place for better control of the steam/water chemistry and for ease of maintenance. Stainless-steel sample lines are drawn to a central sample table, where the samples are cooled in sample coolers, their pressure is reduced in pressure reducing valves, and the flow is maintained prior to bringing the samples into contact with their respective analyzers. Various types of chemical analyzers are provided in a thermal power plant to check purity, assess carryover of silica and sodium, detect oxygen ingress, monitor pH, etc. Some common analyzers along with their location for monitoring are shown in Table 9.7. 9.3 ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS Each unit has a unique electrical distribution system, as discussed in this section.

When plant operators perform this control it is called manual process control [1]. As plants become larger in size and more complicated, more errors occur because of plant operators not understanding the interactive actions among the controls of the plant’s various equipment and systems. These interactive actions require so arduous degree of manipulation skill that it outperforms the capabilities of plant operators. In such cases, machines take over the rein and perform these actions effort- lessly. Machines relieve operators from many monotonous and tedious actions and perform functions that are beyond the physical abilities of humans [2]. These compre- hensive actions by machines are termed as automatic control that ensure [3]: i. Control of processes more rapidly and consistently than human beings can ii. Elimination of work not requiring human mental effort iii. Work with a much higher skill iv. Elimination of human error v. Efficiency of operation The function of automatic control systems is to control output variables. They are dynamic systems that change with time and are integrated systems of components. The fundamental tasks an automatic control system should perform are first to reduce the effect of load disturbances and second to guide the system variables to follow the desired set points. There are two concepts that provide the basis for automatic control strategies: feedback or closed-loop control and feed-forward or open-loop control [2]. Feedback control is the more commonly used technique, in which output signal/s in the flow stream are returned to the incoming control path to moderate any deviation of the measured variable from its desired status. This means that in a feedback control system the controlled variable tends to become equal to the desired value regardless of external disturbances. The effect of feedback is to make the controller aware of its control action. ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

The boiler and its control system must therefore be capable of satisfying rapid changes in load. The independent variable in a boiler that generates saturated steam may be either temperature or pressure (but not both) at boiler outlet. While both temperature and pressure have to be controlled independently in a boiler generating superheated steam [3]. For operation and control of the boiler, monitoring of steam pressure is sufficient to detect any mismatch between fuel-energy input and energy content in the output steam. To obtain the desired outlet conditions of steam (pressure, temperature, flow, etc.), the amount of fuel, air, and water are adjusted. However, control of the boiler is not only limited to adjustment of fuel, air, and water. The overall boilercontrol system isdividedintosub-controlsystemstomeetthegivenrequirementsasfollows[5]: 1.

Single-element control In small boilers with relatively large drum storage volumes (about 120s of storage capacity (between the normal level and low-low level) at BMCR) and slow-changing loads or during low-load operation of large boilers, feedwater flow is controlled by the drum level alone (Figure 10.6). The measured drum level signal is compared with its set point and the resulting error is fed to a con- troller to produce the feedwater flow control signal to regulate the low-load feed con- trol valve.

Conversely, a decrease in load would cause the drum pressure and eventually the density of the fluid to increase, leading to “shrink” or fall in the water level, rather than increase, resulting in an increase of the feedwater flow, instead of a decrease. Three-element control For high-load operation of large boilers, with reduced drum sizes having reduced storage capacity (about 20(cid:1)30s storage capacity or even less (between normal level and low-low level) at BMCR) or with severely fluctuat- ing loads, a three-element control is used.

The three elements are “steam flow,” “feedwater flow,” and “drum level.” In a typical control system, the measured drum level signal is compared with its set point and the resulting error is summed with the pressure and temperature compensated steam flow signal to establish the demand signal for the feedwater flow. This demand signal is compared with the measured value of the temperature-compensated feedwater flow. The resulting error is fed to a controller to produce the feedwater flow control signal to regulate the full-load feed control valve. Further, since the drum storage capacity in this case is low, the effect of “swell” and “shrink” is severe. Hence, the necessary provision to take care of the “swell” and “shrink” under transient load change conditions is built into the control system as shown in the top-right column blocks of Figure 10.7 marked with an arrow pointing left. 360 ThermalPowerPlant Feed water Main steam flow measured flow measured value value From single element Summator Difference control unit unit Difference Integral unit unit Controller Control Valve high range feed position control valve Figure10.7 Three-elementdrumlevelcontrol.

While a reduction in steam temperature from design results in loss of plant efficiency, an increase in steam temperature may result in overheatingandfailureofsuperheaterandreheatertubesaswellasturbineblades. In practice, even at rated load it is difficult to maintain the rated steam temperature. As a result a 65K deviation from the rated steam temperature is recommended in the ABMA(American BoilerManufacturersAssociation) boiler specification.In a boiler the steam temperature may fluctuate because of a change in any of the variables: load, excess air, burner operation, feedwater temperature, fuel quality, heating surface cleanliness, blow-down saturated steam bleed, etc. Hence, in order to control steam temperature, it is necessary to handleloadchangesandoperatingvariablesbyoneormoreofthefollowingmethods: Excess air control Increasing excess air increases flue-gas velocity over tubes, which in turn raises heat transfer to the convective heat transfer surfaces. As a result, both the superheat and reheat steam temperature will increase.

A reduction in excess air or flame length has the opposite effect. Increasing excess air, however, also increases exit gas temperature, which reduces the boiler efficiency. Hence, excess air is not used as a principal steam tem- perature control method. Figure 10.9 shows superheat steam temperature control by increased excess air. ygrene taeH 362 ThermalPowerPlant Total heat available Heat in gas Entering superheater Decreased heat absorption in furnace caused by excess air increase 100 125 Figure 10.9 Steam temperature control by increased excess air.

CH16: Superheaters,ReheatersandAttemperators[7]. 364 ThermalPowerPlant Figure10.11 Steamtemperaturecontrolbygasbypass. Gas bypass control Steam temperature control by gas bypass is adopted in those boilers where boiler convection banks are arranged in the second pass in such a manner that the front parallel convection pass passage contains a reheat transfer surface, and the rear pass contains a superheat heat transfer surface (Figure 10.11). Each heat transfer surface is provided with gas bypass proportioning dampers. When the reheat steam temperature becomes too low, the flue-gas flow through the reheat pass is increased by opening the reheat bypass damper further, consequently the flue-gas flow through the superheat pass reduces. Conversely, if the reheat steam temperature is too high, the reheat bypass proportioning dampers close, reducing the flue-gas flow through the reheat pass and more heat is then transferred to the super- heater, where de-superheating spray water flow is increased to restrict the superheat steam temperature increase. Adjustable burner control The flue-gas temperature at the furnace outlet could be maintained at varying steam generation by changing the relative furnace volume and water wall heat-absorbing surface by using either tilting burners or biased firing. Control of steam temperature with tilting burners is normally used in corner-fired boilers. With a change in burner tilt, the elevation of the fireball within the furnace changes, which in turn changes the heat absorption in the furnace with a consequent change in the quantity of heat delivered to the convective superheater and convective Convection superheater High superheater Low superheater 2,200 2,100 reheater. To raise the steam temperature, burners are tilted upward, and to reduce the steam temperature burners are tilted downward. Figure 10.12 shows the control of superheat/reheat steam temperature by burner tilt. In a boiler where burners are located over the furnace wall, biased firing is adopted to control steam temperature (Figure 10.13).

To raise the steam temperature the upper-level burners are preferentially used, while to reduce the steam temperature the lower level burners are put into service. Control of combination superheaters The control of a combination radiant- convective superheater is relatively simple because of its compensating characteristics (Figure 10.14). With an increase in steam demand, both fuel and air-flow increase, resulting in an increase in flue-gas flow. As a result, convective heat transfer coeffi- cients increase. Thus, steam receives greater heat transfer per unit mass flow rate and the steam temperature increases with load. The radiation heat transfer is proportional to the flame temperature, which is not strongly dependent on load. Thus, an increase in steam flow due to an increased load demand would result in a reduction on exit steam temperature, the opposite effect of a convection superheater. 20 40 60 Control of separately fired superheaters This control is not generallyeconom- ical for a large utility boiler and is usually used in the chemical process industry. It is adopted in boilers having a separately fired superheater that permits an operating rate independent of the saturated steam boiler (Figure 10.15). The superheater is provided with its own burner, fans, combustion chamber, controls, etc. To achieve a reasonably flat steam temperature-load curve the firing rate is adjusted commensurate with a change in load. Attemperation Attemperation is the process of reducing the steam temperature by removing heat from the superheated steam with the help of a desuperheating appa- ratus called an attemperator. There are two types of attemperators: surface attempera- tor (also known as a non-contact attemperator) and a spray or direct contact attemperator. The surface attemperator may further be classified as a header type, shell tube type, or a submerged or drum type. Header type In this type the superheater inlet header is enlarged to accommo- date the heat exchanger tubes carrying cool water (Figure 10.16). The header type attemperator has a limited control range because of the restricted diameter of the headers. Shell tube type Steam temperature control by using a shell and tube type attemperator is sometimes adopted in relatively small-sized boilers from economic consideration. The control range of the shell tube type attemperator is limited. In this type, the shell and tube heat exchanger is fitted into a pressure vessel (Figure 10.17).

The cooler steam coming from this heat exchanger remixes with the primary steam prior to entering the secondary superheater. Thus, the steam temperature is maintained by controlling the quantity of diverted steam. Submerged type This type is similar to the shell tube type, except that the heat exchange between the diverted steam and boiler water takes place within the boiler drum (Figure 10.18). Spray or direct contact attemperator In this type of attemperator the steam temperature is reduced by spraying low-temperature water from either high-pressure feedwater heater outlet or boiler-feed pump discharge header into the line between the low-temperature superheater outlet and the high-temperature superheater inlet (Figure 10.19). The spray nozzle injects water into the throat of a mixing venturi, where water mixes with high-velocity steam in the throat, vaporizes, and cools the steam (Figure 10.20). The spray type attemperator is by far the most satisfactory one, since it provides a rapid and sensitive means of steam temperature control. The effect of the spray attemperator is shown in Figure 10.21. 10.2.3 Combustion control The function of a combustion control system is to control fuel and air input or firing rate to the furnace to maintain the superheat steam pressure at the turbine inlet at the desired value as dictated by load demand.

It should also be ensured that for safety the fuel addition be limited by the amount of available combustion air. The combustion control system comprises two subsystems: fuel flow control and total air-flow control (Figure 10.22). The megawatt load signal is compared with a function of steam flow signal; the resultant error signal is then corrected by the system frequency deviation to generate the operating level of the system. The measured throttle (HP turbine inlet) pressure is compared with its set value.

Oil and gas involve the simplest controls, since they can be measured easily and flow is regulated by a control valve in the fuel line. On the other hand, since coal is an unmeasured fuel, the control system is open-loop, in which a fuel demand signal positions a coal- feeding device (speed variator of coal feeder) directly. 5% 0% Total air-flow control To maintain proper fuel-air ratio, air flow should also be controlled per the load demand, either by varying the fan speed, by throttling fan inlet vane/damper/blade pitch, or by a combination of damper and speed control. The fir- ing rate demand should be limited by the fuel flow to ensure an adequate air supply for safe combustion of fuel. Toensurecomplete combustionof all thefuel,itis alwaysnecessary tosupply more air than is required by proper fuel-air ratio, which may change due tovariations in fuel calorific value, specific gravity, temperature, and other physical properties of either fuel or air. In most boilers, the desired excess air is not constant, but decreases as load is increased (Figure 10.23). Hence, it is essential to adjust the fuel-air ratio automatically. Thisisdonebyprogrammingthe%O setpointasafunctionofboilerload. 2 Maintaining the correct fuel-air ratio results in fuel savings and limits the following for safety purposes: i.

The opening of throttle valves is influenced by the turbine- governing system, per the steam flow demand. The turbine-governing system is com- prised of three control loops: speed control loop, load control loop, and initial pressure control loop as shown in Figure 10.27. These loops are discussed in the following sections. 10.3.1 Speed controller The speed controller compares the speed reference value with the actual speed of the turbine and accordingly provides an output for the throttle valve lift. The reference speed signal ensures that the highest permissible rate of speed is consistent with the safe operation of the turbine. The speed controller handles the following operations: i. Start-up of the turbine ii. Synchronization of the generator iii. Minimum load operation iv. Operation of the turbine in the complete power range when the load controller is out of service 10.3.2 Load controller There are three elements, as follows, in this control loop: i. Load limiter ii. Frequency controller iii. Load controller The load controller receives the reference load signal from the load limiter and also from the frequency controller, depending on the frequencyof grid. The reference load setvalueensuresthatthehighestpermissiblerateofloadvariationisconsistentwiththe safethermalstressesoftheturbine,bothduringloadincreaseaswellasloaddecrease. 10.3.3 Initial steam pressure controller In the event initial steam pressure at the turbine inlet falls below a preset value the ini- tial steam pressure controller initiates the unloading of the turbine proportionally commensurate with the available boiler pressure. The loading of turbine begins only if the firing rate in boiler is increased."

In this system, signals from the MW load demand and throttle steam pressure are transmitted to both the boiler master controller and the turbine- governing valve controller simultaneously (Figure 10.28). The boiler master controller transmits a single command to all boiler control loops discussed in Section 10.2 so that each controllable parameter adjusts itself within its limit at the same time. Since the response time of the turbine-governing system is almost instantaneous, while the response time of the boiler combustion control is sluggish, the coordinated control system harnesses the advantage of the faster response to adjust any deviation in load demand at the quickest using the stored energy in the steam generator to main- tain the throttle steam pressure. This mode of control takes advantage of the relative benefits of both “boiler following” mode and “turbine following” mode, as discussed in the following. In the event that it is difficult to put a coordinated control system in service, the unit then operates in “boiler following” mode, which literally means the boiler is following the turbine."

Thus, the new load is estab- lished and the throttle steam pressure is brought to its rated value. If there is any failures in the operating turbine integral systems or any of its associ- ated auxiliaries, “the change in MW load demand” signal is issued to the combustion control system first, instead of the turbine governor. Due to the change in firing rate, the throttle steam pressure will change, which is then taken care of by the turbine- governing system to restore the throttle steam pressure. This mode of operation is called the “turbine following” mode, i.e., the turbine is following the boiler (Figure 10.30). However, the response of this mode is slow, because turbine- governing system has to wait to take the corrective action until the firing control changes the energy output from the boiler. The advantage of this mode is that there is least variation in the throttle steam pressure and throttle steam temperature, among all the three modes discussed above. 380 ThermalPowerPlant Megawatt load control Throttle pressure control Turbine Boiler generator control control Feed water Fuel Air Gas flow Turbine flow flow flow distribution valve control control control control control Drum level Firing rate control control Figure 10.30 Turbine-following mode.

During start-up, steam to the deaerator is usually supplied from an auxiliary steam header and deaerator pressure is maintained at a pre-assigned minimum constant pressure, typically about 0.15MPa. Once the machine is loaded, the pressure in the cold reheat line builds up. As this pressure becomes adequate, the steam supply to the deaerator is switched over from the auxiliary steam header to the cold reheat line to maintain another pre-assigned 384 ThermalPowerPlant Flow through large pump Minimum Measured set value value Difference unit Controller Control Pump minimum flow recirculation control valve Figure10.35 Pumpminimumflowcontrol. constant pressure of about 0.35MPa. As the turbine is loaded further, the steam sup- ply to the deaerator is switched over from the cold reheat line to the turbine extrac- tion steam line. Thereafter, the deaerator pressure varies with the turbine extraction steam pressure commensurate with turbine load. 10.5.5 Pump minimum flow recirculation control (Figure 10.35) To ensure the safety of large pumps, e.g., boiler feed pump (BFP), condensate extraction pump (CEP), etc., it is essential to maintain a minimum flow through the pump at all modes of operation. This control valve is located on a separate line tapped from either the individual pump discharge or the common discharge header of pumps. The minimum flow through a pump is maintained by using a pump minimum flow recirculation control valve, circulating fluid from the associated pump discharge line back to its source, i.e., the deaerator feedwater storage tank/condenser hotwell, etc. As long as the fluid flow to the process is at or below the safe minimum limit this control remains in service. When the fluid flow exceeds the safe limit, the pump min- imum flow recirculation control valve is closed.

CHAPTER 11 Interlock and Protection 11.1 INTRODUCTION The interlock and protection system ensures the safety of equipment and personnel as well as the stable operation of a unit within permissible limits at all times. Many abnormalities can occur during normal operation of units, most of which can be cor- rected by operator intervention. However, operation of modern large power plants at times requires instant decision-making and corrective actions that may not be possible by operator action since human reaction time is inherently slow. A sluggish response on the part of operator may lead to catastrophic damage resulting from equipment failure, inadvertent error, and mishandling. To handle such situations the interlock and protection system initiates automatic corrective actions to stabilize the system quickly. This system also handles operations such as automatic cutting in and out of auxiliaries, systems, etc., in sync with changing load conditions. There are many examples of abnormalities that require immediate isolation of a unit for safety of equipment and/or minimizing damage to equipment. The protection scheme is usu- ally designed to trip the equipment automatically with or without time delay, depend- ing on the nature of emergency. Protection to personnel and major equipment may be achieved by resorting to an intrinsically safe design and trained conduct of individual. However, individual con- duct can not be predicted, since it is influenced by ignorance, fatigue, or negligence. Hence, it is essential that a design is intrinsically safe as far as possible so that no single failure in the system would prevent a mandatory shut-down. This aspect of design is called fail-safe. From this perspective, measurement, control, and protection systems are designed such that critical protection and control meet the “2 out of 3 logic” condition (which means if 2 inputs from a combination of 3 similar inputs of the same parameter are satisfied, then the logic will allow the output command to proceed). For less critical protection and control adopting “1 out of 2” (1 input from a combination of 2 similar inputs of same parameter) logic condition would suffice. For guaranteeing safe operation various equipment, particularly larger equipment, of a power plant are provided with different type of interlock and protections. Most major equipment is provided with a start-interlock that prohibits it from starting until its all start permissive are satisfied. Similarly, trip-interlocks are provided for the pro- tection of running equipment in the event of one"

Occurrence of any of these trip- interlocks and/or any off-normal condition, which may damage equipment and/or impair safety, should immediately cause the equipment to stop automatically. In addition to incorporating protective devices, since not all conditions that cause damage are detected by any of the mandatory automatic trip devices, operating per- sonnel must be knowledgeable of the limitations of automatic protection systems. Audio-visual alarms, supplementing interlocks, and other protections are provided to alert the operator when any equipment behaves abnormally or any of the operating parameters go beyond the preset permissible limits. Whenever any abnormal operating conditions occur and/or any equipment trip, corresponding “failure” alarm would alert the operator to take the applicable corrective actions. The three major pieces of equipment in a steam power plant are the steam genera- tor, steam turbine, and electric power generator or alternator. Each piece of equip- ment is provided with a dedicated hand-reset type lock-out relay through which tripping of associated equipment is initiated. Each of these three protection systems is independent of each other, but intertripping interlock among lockout relays is also provided to initiate isolation of the equipment, even if they are not directly affected, but isolation of which is necessary to ensure safety. A similar philosophy is adopted in gas turbine and diesel engine power plants. The following sections cover the interlock and protection of a steam generator, steam turbine, gas turbine, diesel engine, and associated electric power generator or alternator. Interlock and protection of fuel firing equipment is also discussed, since they are integrally tied to start-up and shut-down of steam generators. No attempt, however, has been made to cover all types of protection, since that would be difficult to accommodate in a chapter. The scope of this book also does not cover interlock and protection of other auxiliary equipment associated with steam generator, steam turbine, gas turbine, diesel engine, and alternator. 11.2 STEAM GENERATOR Steam generators today are large in size with a high steam-generating capacity and highly sophisticated firing system. These types of steam generators are more costly and vital to the power grid system than other types. With the increase in unit size and capacity, forced outages have greater significance not only for the larger loss of reve- nue but also for greater risk of injury and more damage"

With the increase in unit size and capacity, forced outages have greater significance not only for the larger loss of reve- nue but also for greater risk of injury and more damage to plants. Additionally, all steam generators, especially pulverized fuel-fired steam generators, are prone to explo- sion hazards due to unstable burning and fire-outs occurring in burners. All efforts should be made at both the design stage as well as during operation to ensure fail-safe operating conditions to prevent furnace explosion as well as furnace implosion. InterlockandProtection 389 An explosion in a container may occur when there is rapid pressure increase accompanied by combustion that propagates pressure waves. This pressure increase gets released by finding the least-resistant path in vent holes, explosion doors, etc. In the worst case scenario the pressure increase gets released by bursting the container. The primary reasons for such pressure build-up may be the result of one or a combi- nation of the following: i. Release of gases as a result of combustion ii. Inadequate escape facilities for ventilation iii. When the crest of pressure waves gets superimposed on the crest of fresh waves, the result is an accentuated effect Explosion in a furnace may occur due to a variety of reasons. Some of the frequently occurring causes are [1]: i. Improper purging of furnace, air, and gas paths ii. Inaccurate ignition procedure iii. Inadequate ignition procedure iv. Fuel supply to the furnace is continued without ensuring proper combustion v. Following a flame-out burners re-lit hurriedly vi. Introduction of main fuel without ensuring adequate ignition energy Statistics reveal that most furnace explosions are attributed to operator error, necessitat- ing improvement in control and detection equipment. It is also known that operator actions are not fast and effective enough to execute parallel activities of multiple operat- ing steps to ensure safe and proper supply and burning of fuel in the furnace. In large steam generators, where the fuel input rate is also high, major furnace explosions can result from the ignition of accumulated fuel even for 1(cid:1)2s. Statistics further reveal that the majorityof explosions occur during start-up, shut-down, and low-load operations.

The BMS should permit starting of equipment in sequence, when a set of preset conditions, necessary for the safety of equipment, are satisfied. When the equipment InterlockandProtection 391 is started, the system will continuously monitor safe operating conditions determined in advance, warn operating personnel, and remove equipment from service in sequence again when the preset safe conditions are not met in practice.

Primary air (PA) fans and associated dampers f. Coal feeders 11.2.2 Sequence of operation Earlier safety was ensured by sequential operation of various boiler auxiliaries. The sequence of starting and stopping used to be designed to ensure that unless the 392 ThermalPowerPlant conveying system, which removes the products of combustion from the furnace, was in service, those feeding fuel and air to the furnace would not run. As such, the start- ing sequence of various boiler auxiliaries is configured as follows: i. Rotary/Regenerative air heaters (if provided) ii. Induced draft (ID) fans iii. Forced draft (FD) fans iv. Primary air (PA) fans v. Seal air fans vi. Pulverizers vii. Coal feeders The stopping sequence of the above boiler auxiliaries should be in the reverse order of the starting sequence. The failure of any equipment in the above order"

Selective interlocking should ensure that with only one of the two ID fans running one FD fan could be operated. Similarly, failure of one of the two FD/PA fans should initiate preferential cut out of running pulverizers as recommended by the equipment manufacturer. 11.2.3 Furnace purge interlock Prior to admitting fuel to an unfired boiler, it is essential to ensure the furnace is free from gaseous or suspended combustible matters. The sequence of activities of furnace purge cycle is as follows: i. Establish AC and DC power supply to BMS and associated equipment ii. Ensure master fuel relay (MFR) is in tripped condition iii. Verify that none of the MFR tripped commands (described below) are present iv. Open air and flue gas path isolating dampers, wind box dampers, and other con- trol dampers to ensure open-flow path from the inlet of FD fans, through the furnace, to ID fans and the chimney v. Place all burner air registers in purge position or ensure all auxiliary air damper positions maintain adequate wind box to furnace differential pressure vi. Ensure all burner headers, igniter header, individual burner, and individual igniter shut-off valve are closed vii. Verify that all PA fans are not running viii. Check all flame scanners show “no flame” condition ix. Establish a minimum of 25% of design full load mass air flow through the furnace x. For pulverized coal-fired steam generators ensure mass air flow through the fur- nace is not greater than of 40% of design full load mass air flow If all above conditions are satisfied “Purge Ready” indication comes ON. Initiate command for “Purge Start.” Such action will maintain above air flow for a period of InterlockandProtection 393 at least 5 minutes. On completion of above time period, “Purge Complete” indica- tion switches ON. The furnace may now be treated to be free from any combustible matter and is ready for fuel firing. 11.2.4 Boiler light-up After the purge is complete, the “MFR Reset” may be initiated provided all operating conditions of the boiler are normal and “MFRTrip” conditions, presented below, are absent. The boiler is now ready for light-up.

Condenser vacuum meets manufacturer’s recommended value viii. All associated equipment and systems are functional Turbine is now ready for admitting steam. (Detail treatment on the start-up and shut-down of steam turbines is given in Chapter 12.) A running turbine may trip due to variety of reasons, e.g., malfunction or trouble in one or more of its auxiliaries and/or operating conditions, abnormal conditions in the boiler, or trouble in the unit electrical system. Tripping of a turbine is initiated through the Turbine Lockout Relay (industrially known as 86Trelay). Turbine protection system is independent of other protection systems of the plant. The governor and the protection system are constructed in such way that failure of any component will not prevent the turbine from being safely shut-down. The turbine protection system may be actuated either electrically or hydraulically. In the event of electric trip, the turbine lockout relay should actuate and energize tur- bine trip solenoid. Both trip solenoid and hydraulic trip system act on the hydraulic control system, which causes fall in control/trip oil pressure leading to closure of HP turbine emergency stop valves (ESVs), HP and IP turbine control valves and IP tur- bine interceptor valves (IVs), thereby shutting off steam supply to turbine. When steam supply to turbine is insufficient to drive the generator, motoring will follow, which is detrimental to the health of turbine blades because of loss of ventila- tion effect of steam flow with consequent overheating of blades. Under such condi- tion it is essential to trip the unit lockout relay (industrially known as 86U relay). In order to ensure safe running of the turbine following automatic trip conditions of turbine are generally provided: 1. Axial shift high (In case of excessive axial shift of the rotor due to thrust, blades and glands of turbine will get subjected to mechanical damage.) 398 ThermalPowerPlant 2. Lube oil pressure very low (In the event of lube oil system failure, bearings would quickly lead to wiping of the journal and thrust bearings). 3. Trip oil pressure very low 4. Condenser vacuum very low (If the condenser vacuum falls below a lower set value, turbine exhaust hood temperature will increase, which may cause damage to the last stage blades due to stress from centrifugal force juxtaposed with thermal stress.

Condenser tubes will also get damaged since under the influence of temperature they will expand and may get buckled.) 5. Turbine over-speed 6. Boiler drum level very high (Excessive increase in boiler drum water level results in carryover of water into steam turbine. Water droplets accompanying steam impinge high speed tur- bine blades and damage the blades severely impairing efficiency of the turbine. Hence, on occurrence of carryover of water, steam supply to turbine should be cut off.) 7. Main steam pressure very low 8.

Main steam/hot reheat steam temperature very high (To prevent creep failure, this protection is provided.) 10. Turbine/generator bearing temperature very high (This protection is provided to protect bearing babbit metal from wiping.) 11. Turbine/generator bearing drain oil temperature very high (Turbine lube oil, being a mixture of hydrocarbons, has a tendency to oxidize. If the oxidation rate is high due to higher temperature sludge will form, which gets deposited in various parts of lubrication system, creating blockage and lead- ing to oil starvation and overheating. Furthermore, with increase in oil tempera- ture, viscosity of the oil will become low resulting in discontinuities in the bearing oil film with consequent damage to bearings.) 12. Turbine/generator bearing vibrationvery high 13. Excessive differential expansion 14. Frequency low (Continuous operation of a turbine with a frequency lower than a recom- mended value may reduce the life of some of the blades, since an under- frequency condition may be the resonance condition for some of the stages resulting in higher stresses in these blades. Nevertheless, tripping a turbine under InterlockandProtection 399 low frequency is not desirable since this will cause further stress to other running units, which may lead to total power failure.) 15.

Prior to starting, it checks all vital systems of turbine, generator, and associated auxiliaries are in a healthy condition ii. During start-up operation, this system maintains all checks and permits to start the turbine iii. The system monitors various protective circuits, and permits the unit to continue if the operating parameters are within limits iv. At any stage of the process, if a vital system fails and indicates that the turbine is not within safe run up parameters, it will trip the machine v. During normal operation, the system provides an overall protection to the turbine against any failure of protective circuits and trips the machine. Prior to starting the gas turbine the following minimum conditions must be met: i. AC and DC power supply to turbine protection, control and associated equip- ment are available ii. None of the gas turbine tripped commands are present iii. Fuel gas pressure at gas turbine fuel gas skid inlet is adequate iv. Fuel oil pressure at gas turbine fuel oil skid inlet is adequate v.

All associated equipment and systems are in service. Once above conditions are satisfied the gas turbine is purged with at least 8% of full- load mass air flow for a period of not less than 5 minutes. The gas turbine is now ready for starting. (Further details on start-up and shut-down of gas turbine are given in Chapter 12.) To prevent damage to gas turbine and auxiliaries from abnormal operating condi- tions arising out of malfunction of equipment or system, a number of protective devices are provided. The protective function supervises parameters of the gas turbine in all phases of operation. The sensors are monitored continuously for malfunctions. InterlockandProtection 401 Whenever such a malfunction does occur, an alarm is given. The protective system includes over-speed, over temperature, flame detection, high vibration, etc., as described below: Over-speed protection The over speed protection actuates whenever speed of the rotor exceeds a preset limit causing closure of fuel gas/fuel oil trip shut-off valve. Over-temperature protection The gas turbine unit is protected against any pos- sible damage caused to the machine in the event turbine outlet gas temperature exceeds a predetermined limit. In such case the over-temperature protection system trips the turbine to arrest any further temperature increase. Flame detection and protection Flame detection device avoids accidental flooding of combustors with unburned fuel due to loss of flame or improper combus- tion. This device is used to detect flame in the combustors and to trip the turbine in case of flame failure. Vibration protection The vibration protection system of the gas turbine unit comprises vibration transducers fitted on various bearing housings and relative shaft vibration transducers at journal bearings. In the event the vibration becomes excessive, the unit will trip to avoid any damage. Lube oil pressure and temperature protection In the case gas turbine lubricat- ing oil pressure drops below a preset low value, the protective system trips the unit. This is to prevent the turbine from being run with inadequate oil supply to bearings and other accessories. Likewise, bearing temperature also trips the unit should the temperature of bearings exceed preset limit. Hydraulic and pneumatic"

These faults generally include the fault inside and outside the protective zone of the generator, generator transformer, and unit auxiliary transformer, and in the case of a steam turbine, low lubricating oil 404 ThermalPowerPlant pressure, high axial shift, etc. The tripping of the generator, initiated through generator lockout relay (industrially known as 86G relay), in turn ensures complete shutting down of the prime mover and the boiler (applicable to steam power plant only). The generator is tripped automatically on occurrence of any of the following typical con- ditions, but may not be restricted to these only: i. Generator over voltage ii. Generator under voltage iii. Generator over current iv. Generator over frequency v. Generator under frequency vi. Generator volts/Hertz high (over flux) vii. Generator differential protection viii. Generator loss of excitation ix. Generator over-excitation x. Excitation system failure xi. Generator stator earth fault xii. Generator rotor second earth fault xiii.

This categorization follows industry practice based on the thermal conditions of steam 414 ThermalPowerPlant turbines, usually the metal temperature of the HP turbine inner casing, at the time of start-up. It is also common in the industry to classify the start-ups on the basis of time since previous shut-down. The various categories of start-up are defined as follows (IEC 60045-1:1991: Steam Turbines Part-1: Specification and/or BS EN 60045- 1:1993: Guide for Steam Turbine Procurement) [1,2]. 12.5.1 Cold start-up This category of start-up is usually followed after a 72-hour shut-down period of the steam turbine when the metal temperature of the HP turbine inner casing is expected to drop below approximately 40% of full-load metal temperature of the casing. 12.5.2 Warm start-up Warm start-up is usually followed after a shut-down period of between 10 and 72 hours when the metal temperature of the HP turbine inner casing is between 40% and 80% of full-load metal temperature of the casing. 12.5.3 Hot start-up Hot start-up is followed after a shut-down period of 10 hours. The metal temperature of the HP turbine inner casing is above approximately 80% of full-load metal temper- ature of the casing. 12.5.4 Very hot start-up When a steam turbine is started within 1 hour after shut-down period, this is treated as very hot start-up. During this start-up, metal temperature of the casing remains at or near its full-load metal temperature. 12.5.5 Line-up of steam turbine before start-up Before the first start-up or the start-up after a overhaul of steam turbines carry out or verify following activities/actions: i. Steam generator has been started up and is ready for supplying steam to steam turbine ii. Alternator, generator circuit breaker, generator transformer, excitation system, automatic voltage regulator, and associated electrical systems are ready for synchronizing with the grid iii. Condenser cooling water inlet valves are closed iv. Condenser cooling water outlet valves are open v. Condenser water box vent valves are open vi.

In the process if any errors occur, due to erroneous operation and/or lack of proper understanding of sequence of operation, catastrophic damage to equipment, safety of the unit, loss of time, loss of generation, and as an ultimate loss of revenue could occur. To relieve operators from having to perform such arduous tasks, there is APS, a computer-aided start-up and (normal) shut-down system. APS, which stands for automatic plant start-up and shut-down system, ensures the automatic start-up and shut-down of a unit according to start-up/shut-down program by a ‘single command’ by an operator. It reduces degree of operator error, start-up/ shut-down time of each unit, and simultaneously enhances safety. APS is based on integrated unit-level-based control philosophy that can be achieved with minimum operator intervention. If for some reason the APS sequence gets stalled the operator may either take the necessary corrective action or consciously bypass that step to ensure that the continu- ityof the start-up/shut-down process does not get"

If for some reason the APS sequence gets stalled the operator may either take the necessary corrective action or consciously bypass that step to ensure that the continu- ityof the start-up/shut-down process does not get impaired. However, operator inter- vention may be inevitable in the event of anyor all of the following conditions: i. Areas or equipment that cannot be automated ii. On occurrence of spurious signal iii. There is lack of required instrumentation iv. Inputs fail to satisfy desired requirement v. Realizing specific requirement of APS The APS sequence is convenientlyhooked upto majorequipment logic sequences, such as the burner management system, automatic turbine start-up system, sequential control system, balance of plant operating system, etc., such that APS appears as a stand-aloneprogramforboththesteamgeneratorandthesteamturbineandgenerator. Before discussing the details of APS, it should be noted that it is not the first start- up of any plant. During the first start-up of a plant there are many areas that may operate in parallel and demand the special attention of the operating personnel. In these cases, more vigilance is needed to observe the individual or interactive behavior of the various systems and equipment before the sequence of activities may proceed. 426 ThermalPowerPlant In contrast, APS is executed in a step-by-step manner. It is like any “automatic control loop” that can be put into service once all associated systems had been started, trialed, tested, and stabilized. Thus, before initiating the APS program there are cer- tain “prerequisite” conditions/areas that need to be handled by the operator. Readers are advised to become familiar with the previous sections as well as the previous chapters to better understand the intricacies of APS. 12.8.1 Automatic start-up The first step in the start-up program is to ensure that all prerequisites are established. Itmustbeensuredthatallassociatedsystems,e.g.,compressedairsystem,rawwatersys- tem, DM water system, CW, ACW, and CCW systems, DCS, etc., are in service and stabilized.Itmustalsobeensuredthatallassociatedelectricpowersupplysystemsarein service and stabilized. Furthermore, since emergency power acts as back-up to power control centers, uninterrupted power supply systems (UPS), and DC distribution boards, the status of emergency power supply is also prerequisites to ensure that in the eventofunitpowerfailuretheprogressoftheAPSsequencewillnotgetinterrupted. These conditions, nevertheless, do not initiate the start-up program. There are many more prerequisite conditions that need to be satisfied before issuing the start-up command. These prerequisites, as follows, are neither prioritized nor put in sequential order, but should all be fulfilled for automatic start-up to progress: 1. Firefighting system is ready to be put into service 2. Power receiving substation is energized 3. LT (415V) start-up switchgears are energized 4. Common power centers are energized 5. Water treatment switchgear is energized 6. Unit power centers are energized 7."

Depending on the type of start-up condition, some permissive conditions are either bypassed or may need to be repeated. Once all prerequisites are satisfied and the status of permissive condition is determined, the operator initiates the single “start-up sequence” command to the “APS start-up program” for it to advance auto- matically and thereby the main sequence is activated (Figure 12.2). As the program advances, it issues commands to various equipment to start and then checks back to determine whether the command was realized. If satisfied, the program advances further sequentially from the source of the DM water up to the loading of turbine. The APS flow diagram of a typical pulverized coal-fired power plant is very com- plex and large in size, which is difficult to accommodate in a single chapter. Therefore, a general step-by-step automatic start-up sequence is given in Table 12.1 for simplicity. While preparing Table 12.1 the input criteria at many steps essentially resembles the check-back criteria of the previous step.

With the bypass in service once the turbine load is reduced to 60% (which is the stable load for boiler control) unloading of boiler takes place according to the load on the turbine and the opening of the HP/LP bypass valves. Once the turbine is fully unloaded, the boiler starts unloading to zero load. As in case of the automatic start-up program certain “prerequisite” conditions, as follows, need to be fulfilled by operator action before initiating the shut-down com- mand. This equipment may not remain in service during normal operation, but before initiating automatic (normal) shut-down of the unit, it must be available. 1. Turbine auxiliaryoil pump is available 2. Turbine emergencyoil pump is available 3. Turbine JO pump is available 4. Turbine control oil pump is ON 5.

There is no operator intervention required except for the selection of fuel and the setting of load. The operations take place step-by-step in a pre-set order. 12.9.1 Pre-start checks Before starting the gas turbine, the following must be inspected and checked: 1. Gas turbine and its components are in a state of tidiness and no rags or tools are lying in or around them 2. Maintenance work (if any) on different parts of the unit has been completed and all permit to work cards have been returned by authorized maintenance person- nel duly signed 3. Inspect all parts of the plant subjected to maintenance work and make sure that all maintenance personnel have been withdrawn and the plant is ready for start- up 4. “Danger” tags from valves and switchgears, if there be any, are removed 5. All relevant valves in fuel gas conditioning skid as well as fuel oil treatment system are open 6. Drain all drain points of fuel gas conditioning skid 7. Gas pressure at gas turbine fuel gas skid inlet is adequate 8. Oil pressure at gas turbine fuel oil skid inlet is adequate 9. Check that air intake filter house is free of accumulated water either by opening drain plugs or by visual inspection 10. Starting device is switched on 11. Turbine lube oil tank level is at normal or above 12. Lube oil pressure drop across strainers, filters, and also oil flow through sight glasses are within normal limit 13. Lube oil pressure is equal to or above the recommended value 14. All systems, i.e., fuel gas, fuel oil, lube oil, etc., are tight and no visible leakage exists 15. Earthing is in order 16. All control and power fuses are in place 17. Battery voltage and charging equipment are in order 18. All control and selector switches are in proper sequence for start-up program 19. Electrical control and protection systems are not isolated and are in service 20. Annunciations, instruments, all indicating lamps are healthy 21.

Check that “generator transformer”, “unit auxiliary transformer”, various electri- cal boards and power supply systems, etc., are in(cid:1)ready to operate” position 23. Auxiliary power supply is at the rated voltage and frequency 24. Fire-detection system and automatic CO fire-extinguishing system are in order 2 25. Portable fire extinguishers are in place around machinery space, fuel oil skid, fuel gas skid, etc. Once these conditions are satisfied the gas turbine is purged with at least 8% of full-load mass air flow for a period of no less than 5 minutes. The gas turbine is now ready to start. 12.9.2 Start-up, Synchronizing, and Loading Start-up of a gas turbine essentially means regulation of the fuel flow to the gas turbine at the initiation of a start signal. During this period the fuel/air ratio is maintained so theoutletgastemperaturedoesnotexceedpermissiblelimitsatmaximumacceleration. The typical gas turbine start-up and synchronization procedure is as follows: 1. Check that field breaker is OFF and AVR is operative 2. Ensure starting power from an external source 3. Gas turbine auxiliaries are thus placed in service 4. Gas turbine set is then accelerated with the help of starting device until the turbine is ignited and self-sustaining speed is reached 5. Governing system then takes over and accelerates the set to synchronous speed 6. After the machine has attained the synchronous speed, the synchronizing device adapts the turbine speed to match the grid frequency; the machine voltage is then brought to the rated value 7. While connecting to the grid, the parameters of frequency, phase angle, and volt- age are adjusted to suit the grid; the generator is then synchronized with the grid by closing the generator circuit breaker. 12.9.3 Normal operation During loading and subsequent operation of the machine, the primary responsibility of the operator is to observe and record the operational parameters of the main unit as well as its auxiliaries and ancillaries and to take corrective measures when required to control the machine. The operator must also keep a close watch on the perfor- mance of the generator exciter, AVR, and load regulator. During start-up and normal operation, the following parameters should remain at or within the predetermined limits: 1. Bearing temperature and vibration 2. Operating parameters of turbine oil system Start-UpandShut-Down 445 3. Compressor discharge pressure 4. Turbine exhaust temperature 5. Wheel space temperature 6. Fuel pressure 7. Temperatures of stator winding and rotor winding 12.10 NORMAL SHUT-DOWN OF GAS TURBINE Before stopping the"

Normal shut-down of gas turbine is initiated by a stop signal resulting in total cut-off of fuel flow to the gas turbine. 12.11 EMERGENCY SHUT-DOWN OF GAS TURBINE To protect the gas turbine from serious damage in the event of failure of open- and/ or closed-loop control systems emergency shut-down of gas turbine is followed to shut-off the fuel supply to gas turbine without waiting for unloading the unit. 12.11.1 Unit cool-down and shut-down checks (normal or in the case of an emergency) Immediately following a shut-down, the gas turbine should be put on barring gear for a period of predetermined time to assist in uniform cooling of the turbine rotor. Uniform cooling of the turbine rotor prevents rotor bowing and resultant rubbing and unbalance, which might otherwise occur on subsequent starting attempts. The barring device is interlocked with a lubricating oil and jacking oil system and will not operate until the lube oil and jacking oil supply to the bearings is established. The minimum cool-down time depends on the ambient temperature and air draft. However, if the machine is not going to remain idle for a prolonged period, it is advisable that the barring operation be continued until a subsequent starting attempt is made. The following checks have to be made after the machine is shut down: i. Lube oil pump is maintaining good flowof oil at each bearing ii. Battery charger voltage and current are normal iii. Investigate any faults found during running iv. Perform any repair/maintenance, as required v. Open exhaust duct drain cock vi. Fuel gas and fuel oil source is isolated and secured vii.

When any abnormal condition occurs operating personnel should investigate the reason/s for such occurrence following the steps described below (not necessarily in this order) and take whatever corrective actions are needed: i.

For a natural circulation boiler, the drum level is one of the most important parameters that must be continuously monitored and maintained throughout the period of operation [2]. The automatic control system of a steam generator will normally be able to main- tain specified limits of various parameters, i.e., furnace draft, drum level, steam temperature, steam pressure, etc., but when it fails to do so, audio-visual alarms must alert the operator. (More details on automatic control are found in Chapter 10). 13.2.1 High drum level An abnormal increase in drum water level may be caused by (a) sudden load demand, (b) malfunction of feed-regulating system, and/or (c) safety valve blowing. In the event of a “drum level high” alarm the operator should immediately check the feed-regulating system and change the control from auto to manual, if required. Boiler drum drain valves may be opened to restore the normal water level in the drum. An excessive increase in drum water level may result in carryover of water into the superheater or steam turbine, resulting in erosion/corrosion of the steam path. Necessary steps have to be taken"

An excessive increase in drum water level may result in carryover of water into the superheater or steam turbine, resulting in erosion/corrosion of the steam path. Necessary steps have to be taken by the operator to prevent such occurrence. Interlocks should be provided for tripping the master fuel relay (MFR) [3] and the tur- bine lock-out relay if the level becomes excessively high. 13.2.2 Low drum level Ahigh-pressureboilerhasinsignificantwatercapacitycomparedtoitssteaming rate.Any interruptionoffeedtotheboilerforanyreason,foracoupleofminutes,sometimeseven for less than a minute, will cause the disappearance of the water level from the gauge glass/level indicator mounted on the drum.

The standby boiler feed pump should start immediately in the case of tripping of any of the running feed pumps. Prompt operator action may prevent outage of the unit and other conse- quences of loss of feedwater to the boiler. In the case of tripping of running feed pumps andfailure to change over to standby, the load should be immediately reduced to restore thedrumlevel.Ontheotherhand,ifthedrumwaterlevelcannotbemaintained,thefire will be immediately killed and the turbine tripped manually or through an interlock beforethewaterleveldisappearsfromthedrumgaugeglass/levelindicator. AbnormalOperatingConditions 451 13.2.4 Break-down of feed system/feed regulating station Since the feed line is welded, its failure can be almost ruled out, although leakage through valve glands or cover joints cannot be eliminated. Immediate or planned shut-down of the unit will depend on the extent of leakage, but the unit has to be taken out of service for necessary repairs, in any case. In the case of failure of the operating feed regulating valve, the 100% emergency feed bypass valve must be cut in without delay and the failed one isolated, pending shut-down and rectification of the defect. In the event of failure of both valves, load on the unit should be immediately reduced and the water level in boiler-drum maintained by cutting in the low-load feed regulating valve until a planned shut-down can be arranged. 13.2.5 Heavy tube rupture Failure of one or more tubes in a boiler can be detected by sound and either by an increase in make-up water requirement (indicating failure of water carrying tubes) or by an increased draft in the superheater or reheater sections (due to failure of superheater or reheater tubes).

Failure of tubes may occur due to various reasons, such as overheating, erosion by soot-blowing steam or ash particles, or by corrosion on the water and/or steam side. A pin-hole leakage on one or more tubes can usually be tolerated, since with a feed-regulating system with adequate margin, the unit may have a planned shut-down. However, continued operation of boiler under such conditions may cause considerable erosion damage to adjacent tubes as well, making a relatively simple and short repair job to become a major one. Hence, an operator has to apply his judgment to assess the extent of failure and to decide corrective action/s to be taken. In the event of heavy tube rupture, maintaining boiler drum water level may prove difficult. Heavy leakage of water into the furnace may also cause disturbance in combustion, even loss of fire. In this case, the unit must be immediately shut down. Fuel feed and load will have to be stopped immediately by actuating the MFR emergency trip push button. The induced draft (ID) fan damper should be opened to maintain the draft in the furnace to cope with heavyevolution of steam in the furnace due to leakage of water from boiler tube/s. Damage to tubes due to any cause has to be repaired. Repair work of a damaged tube consists of cutting off the tube section sufficiently above and below the damage and then inserting and re-welding a new tube section. 13.2.6 High superheat temperature The superheat temperature may increase abnormally due to malfunction of the temperature regulation system and/or sudden increase in heat input to superheater 452 ThermalPowerPlant elements. The attemperators provided for automatic control of the superheater outlet steam temperature normally are able to maintain the steam temperature within the specified limits. Heat input to the superheater may increase gradually over a period of time due to changes in the furnace heat absorption pattern resulting from slagging, etc., or an increase in heat input may be sharp due to late/secondary combustion, high excess air, sudden increase in fuel burning rate, etc. In the case of slagging, it is necessary to operate the soot blowers. In other cases, it is necessary to adjust fuel and air suitably for proper combustion. Should the automatic control fail to regulate manual control should be immediately restored for the safety of equipment.

An audio-visual alarm annunciation should appear in the event of “high superheat temperature.” 13.2.7 Low superheat temperature Low superheater outlet steam temperature results in increased moisture content in the steam going to the turbine later stages with consequent risk of increased erosion rate and hence should be avoided. A sudden drop in superheat temperature also causes quenching of hot metal surfaces resulting in the development of abnormal stresses in metal surfaces of superheaters, headers, main steam pipes, turbine stop valves, steam chests, high-pressure turbine inlet, and first stage region. The contraction of the turbine rotor due to sudden chilling may lead to severe rub and vibration. The superheater outlet steam temperature may drop sharply due towater carryover from boiler and/or due to malfunction of the attemperator system. In either case, immediate action must be taken to reduce carry over and bring back steam temperature within specified limits. A gradual decrease in attemperator water flow and/or superheated steam temperature over a period of time is an indication of fouled superheater elements and should be taken care of by periodic soot blowing. It is obvious that exposing a turbine to an abnormally high rate of steam temperature fall or to run it at a substantial load with an abnormally low superheat steam temperature for an extended period is undesirable. In either case, steps should immediately be taken to restore safe conditions. Interlocks have to be incorporated to trip the turbine at a preset low temperature. An audio-visual alarm annunciation should be provided indicating “low superheat temperature.” 13.2.8 High and low reheat temperature The reheat steam temperature should be kept within specified preset limits. While high reheat temperature will cause damage to reheater metal, low reheat temperature will result in temperature strain in reheater metal and steam turbines. Audio-visual alarm annunciation are provided for “high”/”low” reheat temperature. In the event AbnormalOperatingConditions 453 of a high or low reheat temperature alarm, the operator should check the regulator, and if it fails to operate automatically, manual control should be restored. Reheat steam temperature may exceed a predetermined high limit due to either malfunction of reheat temperature regulator, or high gas temperature in the reheater zone. A high reheat temperature is automatically regulated in two stages. First, the control is accomplished by regulating the burner tilt or by gas bypass or by any other means specific to a typical boiler design. If even after such corrective action, reheat steam temperature still increases emergency spray water attemperators should be used. If attemperators fail to operate automatically the spray water attemperator should be operated manually. The reheater outlet steam temperature may"

The reheater outlet steam temperature may drop sharply due to water carryover from the attemperator system and/or due to malfunction of attemperator system. Temperature may also drop due to fouled reheater tubes. In the case of slagging in reheater tubes, the operator should activate soot blowers to remove deposits in reheater tube elements. For low reheat temperature, the operator should stop feeding spray water, if already in service, and regulate the burner tilt/gas bypass to bring up the temperature. 13.2.9 Loss of ID and FD fans Loss of both ID or both forced draft (FD) fans or all four fans at a time is a rare phe- nomenon and is usually caused by an electrical problem involving complete loss of the unit. In either case, the MFR will be actuated through interlock [3] and the turbine will also be tripped preceding investigation of the malfunction. However, if it is possi- ble to restart the fans immediately, it may be possible to relight the fire after purging. Automatic tripping of the FD fan on tripping of associated ID fan or vice-versa, i.e., tripping of ID fan with FD fan (when all four fans are running), should be provided in order to stabilize the draft quickly. In either case, the load on the turbine should be reduced to about 60% of the maximum rating, which approximately corresponds to the maximum rating of one set of fans. The operator’s goal should be either to ensure rapid stabilization of the furnace by manipulation of ID/FD fan controls, and cutting in oil support if necessary, and/or to prevent rapid loss of pressure and temperature of the main steam by shedding load in excess of 60% of the maximum rating and by adjusting steam temperature controls. 13.2.10 Flame instability The stability of a flame is primarily dependent on the ability of each burner to burn the fuel successfully. Each gas/fuel oil/pulverized coal burner should be provided with at least one flame detector/scanner and continuously monitored individually to initiate the basic signal for operation of flame failure protection. 454 ThermalPowerPlant Flame in a furnace is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, so that during steady state operation, the furnace draft remains constant. In contrast, frequent and/or excessive variation of the furnace draft indicates lack of equilibrium resulting from an unstable flame condition in the furnace.

In contrast, frequent and/or excessive variation of the furnace draft indicates lack of equilibrium resulting from an unstable flame condition in the furnace. From a practical point of view a balanced draft furnace is considered as stable if the furnace draft is maintained within (-) 0.05kPa to (-) 0.10kPa under normal operating conditions. Furnace instability in a boiler may generally result from the following conditions: 1. Sudden change in firing rate due to sharp change in load demand 2. Malfunction of ID and/or FD fan/s regulating system 3. Loss of any draught fan group 4. Air-rich or fuel-rich mixture causing improper “fuel-air” ratio leading to either incomplete or secondary combustion 5. Sudden change in qualityof fuel 6. Interruption in fuel-oil firing due to improper atomization and/or failure in supply of this fuel 7. Non-uniform pulverized coal flow resulting from defect in pulverizer, choked fuel pipe, arching in bunker, etc. In the event of flame instability, it is best to promptly transfer both fuel and air controls to “manual” and adjust them manually until a stable fire is established. While this process of manual control is in progress it may be necessary to restrict the maximum/minimum load and fluctuation of load on the unit temporarily. It may also be necessary to cut in supplementary fuel to service to stabilize flame. Once the flame becomes stable, the cause of instability can be investigated thoroughly and necessary corrective measures taken. 13.2.11 Flame failure trip The signal from the flame failure trip system is used to trip the boiler or affected fuel burner or group of burners.

The oil supply may fall for the following reasons: i. Lack of adequate oil in oil tank ii. Inadequate pressure of oil at the suction of fuel oil pump/s due to choked suction filter and/or low temperature (high viscosity) of oil resulting in flow difficulties iii. Improper operation of fuel oil pump or its relief and/or pressure-regulating valve iv.

An idle gun should not be left inserted 4. In the event of carbon deposit, gun and tip assemblies should be removed, cleaned thoroughly, and then reassembled 5. Adequate oil pressure/temperature, atomizing media pressure, and instrument air pressure should always be ensured 6. Lubrication of all moving parts should be checked periodically 7. Check burner cylinder seals, compression fittings, etc., and replace if necessary 8. Oil samples should be tested periodically at the laboratory to check viscosity-temperature relation 9. Periodically check external piping and valves for evidence of leaks, etc. 10. Check that oil/steam hoses are hanging freely without any sharp bend 11. Constant attention is required for flame-failure devices to ensure that the sensitivity of these is not impaired by carbon deposits ordust on the viewing windows. 13.2.15 Air heater fire Air heater fire is caused mainly by the accumulation of combustible matter, chiefly oil droplets and unburned pulverized coal, which impair heat transfer across heating AbnormalOperatingConditions 457 elements resulting in an increase of gas side temperature and consequent ignition of the combustible matter. Air heater fires are indicated by a sharp increase in temperature of both air and flue gas leaving the air heater. The chance of air heater fire occurring in a particular boiler increaseswith the increase in the numberof start-stop operations. Whenever there is an indication of an air heater fire, steps should be taken immediately to investigate. If there is fire, the affected air heater should be isolated by closing all dampers, doors, etc., to starve the fire of oxygen. If the fire is in initial stages, i.e., only the combustible deposits are burning, it may go out. However, if the metal has started burning, the temperature will be in the order of 2500(cid:1)3100K [4]. In such cases, the location of the fire should be flooded with huge quantities of water. After the fire has been extinguished completely and the unit cooled, the air heater is thoroughly cleaned and the necessary repairs"

After the fire has been extinguished completely and the unit cooled, the air heater is thoroughly cleaned and the necessary repairs done. In addition to the above, pulverized coal-fired boilers also suffer from the following typical abnormal conditions. 13.2.16 Loss of Primary Air (PA) fan Sudden tripping of a PA fan will in general result in marked disturbance in the furnace and may affect flame stability, apart from drop in boiler outlet steam pressure and temperature. In the event of loss of one of the running PA fans, the first action has to be automatic preferential tripping of running pulverizers as recommended by manufacturers. Thereafter, urgent action should be taken to stabilize the flame by put- ting oil support followed by load runback commensurate with the number of pulverizers in service. This will prevent an abnormal drop in boiler outlet steam pressure and temperature. At the same time all out effort should be made to cut in the standby pulverizer/s as earliest as possible to restore the unit output. 13.2.17 Loss of coal feeder Loss of a coal feeder causes raw coal feed to associated puverizer to shut off. Since in a direct firing system, fuel is fired according to the requirement of the steam demand and reserve fuel in a pulverizer is very limited, a loss of feed will cause unbalance in operating pulverizer/s, thereby impairing the furnace stability. Prompt operator action is essential to prevent this and restore normalcy without imposing undue restrictions on the operating load requirement. If the cause of feeder trip is the loss of one group of draft fans, bring down the load to about 60% with careful control of furnace draft, drum level, and steam temperature. If the feeder is tripped due to jamming, a faulty condition in electrical supply, or overload, shut down the associated pulverizer after determining that it is empty (indicated by dying flame). Light oil burner/s or put in-service standby pulverizer/s to restore the load. The defective coal feeder can then be inspected and defect rectified. 458 ThermalPowerPlant 13.2.18 Loss of pulverizer Whenever there is a loss of a pulverizer, the operator should light oil burner/s to help the operating group of pulverizers to stabilize the flame. At the same time, the operator should bring down the load matching to the capability of the running puverizer/s.

In the case of jamming in the pulverizer internals, the affected pulver- izer should be cooled and cleaned and prepared for the next operation. After tripping of a pulverizer it is recommended to adopt the following corrective actions [3]: “a pulverizer that is tripped under load will be inerted as established by equipment manufac- turer, and maintained under an inert atmosphere until confirmation that no burning or smoulderingfuelexistsinthepulverizerorthefuelisremoved.Inertingmediamaybeanyone ofCO , Steam or N .

If allowed to stand for a considerable period of time, the coal remaining inside may ignite. Therefore, either this pulverizer should be put back into service as soon as possible, or it should be emptied manually. In the event of a fire inside an empty pulverizer, prevent smoking to develop, keep fire extinguishers handy, and take the following corrective steps: i. Close the cold air damper. Check that the hot air shut-off damper, mill outlet coal-air dampers, and fuel pipe dampers are all closed ii. Open windbox doors partially and drench the interior with a discharge from a fire extinguisher or with steam. Repeat this step every 10 minutes or so until the fire is extinguished iii. Open the access door carefully and allow any gases that may have been generated during the period of fire to escape iv.

Inspect the pulverizer and if satisfied that it is completely clear of traces of fire, it may be put into operation according to the normal procedure. 13.2.20 Fire in operating pulverizer Fire in an operating pulverizer is a rare phenomenon. Nevertheless, if fire outbreaks it must be extinguished promptly and adequately without allowing it to cause any damage or even interruption in operation. Immediate steps to fight this type of fire include smothering it by reducing the supply of oxygen to a point where combustion is no longer supported. Theoutbreakoffireinanoperatingpulverizer mayoccurforthefollowingreasons: 1. Too high an inlet air temperature 2. Burning fuel from a storage dump or a raw coal bunker being fed to the pulverizer 3. Pulverizer when idle might have been subjected to welding or burning and subsequently boxed up with smoldering debris inside and released for operation Fire in an operating pulverizer can be detected by a sudden increase in outlet coal-air temperature. If this occurs the operator should take the following steps: a. If hot air and cold air dampers have not automatically changed over already to give maximum cold air and minimum hot air, carryout this operation manually b. If the rise in outlet temperature could not be arrested even after switching over hot air and cold air dampers following above step and returns to normal within 15 minutes, proceed as follows: 1. Shut down the pulverizer and associated coal feeder. 2. Isolate the mill and close the hot air and cold air dampers. 3. Follow the same steps as given for the “fire in idle pulverizer.” c. Manually switch the feeder control to the highest speed and increase the amount of coal in the pulverizer to the point where there is a possibility of pulverizer choking. If the pulverizer is already operating at its maximum capacity, ensure that the fuel feed is not interrupted. d. In the event that the raw coal feed needs to be interrupted, immediately shut down the pulverizer and the coal feeder. Then close all associated dampers and valves. 460 ThermalPowerPlant e.

A “plugged hopper” may occur when cleaning ash from a hopper and ash arches over the hopper outlet preventing flow. The operator has to then open the fly ash hopper valve of the plugged hopper branch and the fly ash extraction valve of the plugged hopper. Then removing the poke-hole cover of the extraction valve and inserting a poking rod inside the arching that formed to break it. Once cleaned the operator has to start cleaning from the next hopper. After poking and breaking the arches from all hoppers, the sequential operation can be restarted. 13.3 ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS OF STEAM TURBINES A running steam turbine may encounter various abnormalities both during steady-state operation as well as under transient operating conditions. Each of these problems has serious effects on the turbine heat rate and its reliability. Problems generallyencountered during steady-state operation include: a. Off-frequencyoperation b. Off-nominal voltage operation c. Overloading d. High exhaust pressure e. Acid corrosion f. Steam turbine blade failure g. Boiler carry-over deposition on steam path parts Problems that arise in the transition condition are more critical in nature and may cause damage to the turbine. Some of these critical problems include: 1. Water damage to blades due to back flow from heaters 2. Heater flooding 3. Steam hammer in turbine piping 4. Problems of HP turbine stage when load drops to no-load 5. Loss of feed tank water level 6. Loss of vacuum 7. High exhaust hood temperature AbnormalOperatingConditions 461 8. Loss of oil pressure 9. High differential expansion 10. High bearing vibration 11. High axial shift 12. Temporary increase in turbine speed/turbine over-speed 13. Performance deterioration due to erosion, corrosion 13.3.1 Off-frequency operation Sustained operation at more than 1% below the rated frequency causes the long and slender LP stage buckets to vibrate in several different modes and frequencies. When bucket natural frequencies are stimulated by operating condition, they display resonant conditions, where bucket failures are likely to occur. 13.3.2 Off-nominal voltage operation Longer periods of under-voltage operation can lead to excessive heating of generator components, whereas over-voltage may damage the generator’s magnetic components. 13.3.3 Overloading Overloading increases the steam flow. High flow and high pressure overstresses the parts of the unit and increases the potential for damage. 13.3.4 High exhaust pressure trouble Operations at excessive exhaust"

They can also be produced in the event of cooling water leakage in the condenser. The result is corrosion in the turbine steam flow path. 13.3.6 Steam turbine blade failure This failure is generally fatigue failure resulting from excessive vibratory-stress levels. This occurs in the initial wet zone of condensing steam turbines. 13.3.7 Boiler carry-over deposition on steam path parts Boiler carry-over may result in deposits on steam-path parts, which can have a significant effect on unit efficiency, capacity, and reliability. 462 ThermalPowerPlant 13.3.8 Water damage to blades due to backflow from heaters On sudden drop of load, backflow of water and steam from the heaters to the turbine may take place, which may cause significant impingement of fluid droplets on turbine blade. Blade erosion is one of the effects of such impingement. Backflow of steam from extraction steam lines to the turbine may result in turbine over-speed as well [5]. 13.3.9 Heater flooding Excessively high levels of condensate in the feedwater heater shell and consequent flooding of heater tube coils may result chiefly from either inadequate draining of condensate due to malfunction of the heater shell level regulation system, or heavy tube rupture. Backflow of water from heaters to the turbine may cause blade erosion and also quenching of turbine blades leading to thermal stresses in blades. In the case of a high level in any of the feedwater heaters, the affected heater should be completely isolated both on steam and water sides pending inspection and rectification of defects [5]. 13.3.10 Steam hammer in turbine piping Pressure waves, produced by stopping steam flow in a turbine with a rapidly closing valve, is called steam hammer, and these waves propagate through the turbine. The steam hammer in turn reduces the efficiency and reliabilityof the turbine. 13.3.11 Problems in HP turbine stage when load drops to no-load When a turbine-generator loses full load and remains in service carrying auxiliaries, or just spins with no-load, the turbine is subjected to a sudden drop in temperature, which causes high thermal stresses in the initial stages of the HP turbine and consumes some of the cyclic life of the turbine’s high-temperature components.

At the same time, the last stages of the turbine get overheated due to churning and whirling of the steam, which again leads to high thermal stresses. 13.3.12 Loss of feed tank water level In the case of the feedwater tank level falling below the preset emergency level the boiler-feed pump may get vapor bound with consequent risk of damage, which should be avoided at all times. In spite of corrective actions, if the feed tank level remains uncontrolled, it is advisable to shut down the unit along with boiler feed pumps as quick as possible. AbnormalOperatingConditions 463 13.3.13 Loss of vacuum Loss of vacuum in the condenser is generally caused by any or a combination of the following conditions: a. Partial or a complete loss of cooling water b. High condenser hotwell level c. Leakage invacuum system d. Loss of gland seal steam e. Malfunction of vacuum creating equipment, i.e., air ejector/vacuum pump f. Fouled condenser tubes The rapidity of a decrease in vacuum due to causes (a) to (e) depends on the severity of the cause, whereas in case of (f), the decrease in vacuum is generally gradual over time. The remedy, of course, is isolating the cause of the decrease in vacuum and fixing it. 13.3.13.1 Partial or complete loss of cooling water In the event of loss of one of the running circulating water (CW) pumps it is necessary to bring down the load on the turbine so that it is within the capacityof running CW pumps. The cause of failure of the pump should be investigated and rectified, after which it should be put back to service and the unit loaded in conformity with load demand following manufacturer’s instructions. In the event of loss of all CW pumps, and inability to restore any of them within a short period of time, the unit has to be shutdown.However,suchacontingencyis,inallprobability,rarebutmayhappendue toalossofauxiliarypower. 13.3.13.2 High condenser level Too high a level in condenser floods the condenser tubes and restricts passage of exhaust steam inside the condenser interfering with heat transfer causing high back-pressure or in extreme cases may even flood the air suction pipes of vacuum creating equipment.

Pending investigation of the leakage, the standby vacuum-creating equipment may be put in service if necessary. 464 ThermalPowerPlant 13.3.13.4 Loss of gland seal steam Loss of steam to the turbine gland seals may occur in the case of failure of the gland seal steam pressure control valve. The operator should bypass the control valve or place it in manual control and establish seal steam supply at turbine gland seals at recommended pressure. 13.3.13.5 Malfunction of air ejectors The ejector performance is affected by either high/low supply steam pressure to the ejector or by high condensate level in the ejector. In such cases, put the starting air ejector in service immediately along with the running main air ejector to prevent a decrease in vacuum. Care should be taken to ensure the steam valve opens first and then the air intake valve. Put the standby air ejector in service. After vacuum is brought back to normal, take out the defective air ejector by closing the air valve first followed by the steam valve, taking care to watch the vacuum at all times. Then take out the starting air ejector, first closing the air valve and then the steam valve. 13.3.13.6 Malfunction of vacuum pump The vacuum pump performance is affected by failure of either the “electric power supply to the pump” or the “seal water supply to the pump.” In either case start the standby pump, restore the vacuum, and then stop the defective pump. 13.3.13.7 Fouled condenser tubes Fouling of condenser tubes should be taken care of by periodic isolation and cleaning of each the condenser, the frequency of which is best determined by actual conditions. 13.3.14 High exhaust hood temperature The likely causes of high exhaust hood temperature are either low condenser vacuum or continuous operation at a very low steam flow.

AbnormalOperatingConditions 465 Loss of control oil pressure may also result from a failure or rupture of piping, joints, etc., in a high-pressure control oil system. With a turbine running normally and oil supplied by a shaft-driven centrifugal oil pump, the turbine will trip through an interlock in the case of a major fault in the control oil system. In the case of complete loss of lubricating oil supply, the rotor must be brought to complete rest in the shortest time possible. The low lube oil pressure protection must trip the turbine followed by killing of vacuum by opening the vacuum breaker. The rotor should not be put on the turning gear until oil supply to turning gear, bearings, and seals has been restored. If significant time elapses between the rotor coming to a standstill and restoration of oil supply, and if there is a sign of serious rub or shaft warp or bearing run out, the rotor should not be turned. In that case it is advisable to completely cool down the rotor and casing to ambient temperature. The oil supply to bearings should, however, be kept on in order to cool them. 13.3.16 High differential expansion In the case of excessive differential expansion, metal-to-metal contact may occur between stationary and rotating parts of the turbine because of close running clearances. Hence, it is necessary to maintain the high-pressure turbine (HPT), intermediate-pressure turbine (IPT), and low-pressure turbine (LPT) differential expansions within the predetermined limits. An increase in differential expansion may be caused by too fast a change in inlet steam temperature or due to too rapid change in steam flow to the turbine. Hence, in normal running conditions, maintaining the steam temperature as close as possible to the metal temperature and keeping the rate of change of temperature to a minimum will help maintain the turbine differential expansion within the limits. During a cold start-up when the steam temperature is much higher than the metal temperature the expansion tends to go toward positive, i.e., the rotor expands faster than the cylinder, even though provisions are made for warming up the turbine before rolling. Hence, the recommended start-up"

During a cold start-up when the steam temperature is much higher than the metal temperature the expansion tends to go toward positive, i.e., the rotor expands faster than the cylinder, even though provisions are made for warming up the turbine before rolling. Hence, the recommended start-up procedures regarding inlet parameters, rate of raise of parameters, and speed and soaking of the turbine should be strictly adhered to. Similarly, during a hot start when the rotor tends to contract, following the recommended start-up procedures will help keep the differential expansion within the limits. During shut-down the rotor tends to contract, i.e. the cylinder expands faster than the rotor, and it can be controlled if it is a planned shut-down by gradually unloading and reducing the parameters. However, during a trip out, to assist in maintaining differential expansion additional provisions have to be made, such as rotor heating by supplying steam to the HPTand IPT front seal glands. 466 ThermalPowerPlant 13.3.17 High bearing vibration Vibration in the turbine bearing during rolling and loading should be taken seriously and when it exceeds the permissible limit, the turbine should be tripped and the vacuum broken. While rolling, critical speeds should be crossed as quickly as possible without pause. 13.3.18 High axial shift Undue increase in axial shift will lead to overloading of the thrust pads of thrust bearing and eventual failure. It also contributes to bearing vibration and abnormal differential expansion. Protection will be incorporated to trip the turbine and break condenser vacuum at a limiting value of axial shift. All the time during start-up, loading and normal running avoid sharp changes in load and steam parameters. 13.3.19 Temporary increase in turbine speed/turbine over-speed Turbine speed may increase, temporarily exceeding its limit in the event of large load throw off. Temporary increase in turbine speed may cause serious damage to the tur- bine from shaft or blade distortion. Bearing overheating and gland-seal-damages are other results of temporaryover-speed. Over-speed of the turbine occurs when the HP turbine inlet emergency stop valve/s (ESV), IP turbine inlet interceptor valve/s (IV), and/or HPT/IPT inlet control valves fail to close after turbine tripping or steam finding its way into the turbine through extraction lines due to non-closure of “non returnvalves” or through anyother lines connected to the turbine. Over-speed is likely to cause destruction of the turbine, harm to the personnel and damage to the machinery in the vicinity. Hence, a schedule of testing of proper closing of ESV, IV, and extraction line “non-return valves” should be created and fol- lowed strictly. Actual over-speed tests should also be carried out as and when possible. 13.3.20 Performance deterioration due to erosion and corrosion Duringthenormalrunningof aturbinefor prolongedperioditsperformancedeteriorates"

Operation of the engine thereafter becomes hazardous unless due care is taken. Afewtypicalexamplesofsuchproblemsarediscussedinthefollowing[10,11]. 13.5.1 Contamination of engine oil with glycol and water Engine motor oil may get contaminated with glycol and/or water as a result of defective seals, blown head gaskets, cracked cylinder heads, corrosion damage, and cavitation. Such contamination results in formation of sludge, deposits, oil flow AbnormalOperatingConditions 471 restrictions, and filter blockage; impairs lubrication and oil cooling, and in extreme cases may lead to cold seizure of engines. To mitigate these problems maintenance and routine analysis of engine oil must be done. In the event that any contamination is detected it is best to change the engine oil or switch to a better quality lubricant. 13.5.2 Engine knocking In Diesel engines, where fuel is injected into highly compressed air toward the end of the compression stroke, engine knocking is inevitable. In this type of engine there is always a short time lag from the beginning of fuel being injected to the initiation to an appreciable increase in compressive pressure that would cause combustion to start. Fuel accumulated during this short time interval will ignite first in areas of greater oxygen density. The heat and additional turbulence developed by this initial ignition in the combustion chamber cause very rapid combustion of the fresh charge of fuel. This uncontrolled combustion takes place at approximately constant volume, but with a sudden increase in pressure and temperature, leads to diesel knock. To mitigate the occurrence of knocking the following actions are usually taken at the design stage: 1. The compression ratio is raised substantially to produce a temperature within the combustion chamber considerably higher than the spontaneous ignition temperature of the fuel. Nevertheless, the upper limit of compression ratio is determined by the strength of the cylinder, the bearings and also by the stress developedinother parts 2. Degree of turbulence is reduced, but it lowers torque and thermal efficiency 3. Delay period is reduced Fuel’s ignition delay is measured by a scale called the cetane number. In a particular Diesel engine, higher cetane fuels will have shorter ignition delay periods than lower cetane fuels. When the engine"

Experience reveals that operating personnel in general never encountered some of these electrical faults even in their life time. Nevertheless, looking at the safety of an electrical equip- ment and consequent catastrophe that mayoccur, especially in critical equipment such as the generator, large transformers, large induction motors, etc., protective relays are provided to monitor and safeguard all electrical equipment. They must remain ready all the time in anticipation of a fault and act as an insurance against consequent dam- age resulting from a fault, even though many plant experts say that a relay operates far more number of times during testing and maintenance than during actual fault. Currentandvoltagetransformersareprovidedtofacilitateprotectiverelaystodetect faults in electrical equipment. When faults occur these relays selectively remove only the faulty part from the rest of the system by tripping the associated circuit breakers. They must take necessary corrective action with utmost sensitivity, selectivity, and speed. These relays must be selective because there are certain operating conditions inherent to the operation of electrical equipment that arefundamentallyabnormal, but that are not treated as such, e.g., the starting current of an induction motor, magnetiz- ing inrush current of a transformer, and conditions arising from power swings. Under these circumstances a protective relay must ignore the high magnitude of currents and refrain from extending suitable protections against them consciously. Hence, the pro- tective system has to be designed so that protective relays are capable of discriminating"

Hence, the pro- tective system has to be designed so that protective relays are capable of discriminating betweennormaloperatingconditions,abnormaloperatingconditions,andfaults. 13.6.1 Generator Abnormal operating conditions in a generator may occur under any or a combination of the following. If any of these conditions occur within the generator it must be isolated from the grid byopening the generator circuit breaker [12]. i. Over-voltage ii. Under-voltage 474 ThermalPowerPlant iii. Over-current iv. Over-frequency v. Under frequency vi. Volts/Hertz high (over-flux) vii. Differential protection viii. Loss of excitation ix. Over-excitation x. Stator earth fault xi. Rotor second earth fault xii. Split phase protection for inter turn fault xiii. Pole-slip protection xiv. Back up impedance protection xv. Negative phase sequence protection xvi. Rotor high temperature protection xvii. Reverse power relayoperation Some of the above protections are discussed in following. The reasons for over-voltage are normally due to over-speed of the machine and sometimes due to abnormal operation of automatic voltage regulator. Under these conditions the generator must be isolated from the grid. Additionally, over-voltage is also generated by surge due to lightning, which is han- dledbyprovidingsurgearrestersandsurgecapacitors.Transientover-voltagemaybegen- erated by switching surges across the contacts of circuit breakers or when the arcs are grounded.Whileswitchingsurgescanbereducedbyusingtechnologicallyadvancedcir- cuitbreakers,arcinggroundsurgesaremitigatedbyusingresistanceearthing. Sustained over-current may result in overheating of the stator, leading to an increase in winding temperature. Before the increase in temperature can damage the winding, the generator should be isolated. Loss of excitation may result in overheating of the rotor. Therefore, it is advised to isolate the generator on loss of excitation. The negative phase sequence current may cause overheating of the stator, hence the generator needs to be isolated. In the event of tripping of the prime mover, the machine draws power from the grid and the generator starts behaving like a motor. If the prime mover is a steam tur- bine the coolant (steam) flow through the turbine gets stopped, causing overheating of turbine blades, which may lead to distortion of low-pressure stage turbine blades. In the event that the prime mover is an engine, both external and internal combus- tion, load coming on the machine could be as high as 25% of rated load, which is a loss to the system. The natural solution is isolation of the generator. (For further treatment on generator protection refer to, Chapter 11, Interlock and Protection.)

They come in various sizes and configurations. Since transformers are critical and expensive electrical equipment of a power station, any damage to the equipment may lead to unacceptable interruption in power transmission and distribution. Hence, transformers mustbeprotectedagainst adverse operating conditionsby providing suitable protection suchasover-excitationprotectionandtemperature-basedprotection. Depending on its size the failures generally encountered in a transformer are as follows [13]: i. Winding failures resulting from short circuits ii. Core faults iii. On-line tap changer (OLTC) failures iv. Overloading v. Line surge vi. Loose connections vii. Oil contamination viii. Faulty operation, such as improperly set controls, loss of coolant, accumulation of dirt and oil, corrosion, etc. ix. Fire explosions, lightning To handle these problems, transformers are provided with following protective arrangements: 1. Protective covers are provided to restrict access of rain water to the transformer oil-filled compartment 2. Dry air is continuously pumped into the gas space if humidity becomes severe 3. Above atmospheric gas pressure is maintained when oil-filled transformers are installed outside 4. When the transformer is put into service various temperatures and pressures should always be monitored; any parameter exceeding the recommended limit must isolate the transformer from service 5. Surge arresters are installed and connected to the transformer bushing/terminals In addition to the above, protective relays are also provided to circumvent follow- ing abnormal operating conditions of transformers as applicable: i. Oil temperature high ii. Winding temperature high iii. Negative sequence current very high iv. Over-current 476 ThermalPowerPlant v. Standbyearth fault vi. Restricted earth fault vii. Differential protection viii. Buchholz protection 13.6.3 Induction motors In a power station a huge number of induction motors is spread across the station. Abnormal operating conditions of an induction motor include the following: i. Short-circuit in the stator winding: this condition may occur due to an inter-turn fault (between turns of the same phase), inter-phase fault (between different phases), or ground fault (between a phase winding and ground). In the event such a fault occurs the over-current protection must act instantaneously to trip the motor and protect the stator. ii. Cracked rotor bars: cracks in rotor bars develop in motors that are frequently started due to thermal and mechanical stresses. Hence, operators must follow manufacturer’s guidelines and restrict the number of starts per hour as recommended. iii. Bearing failures: this fault occurs due to rotor unbalance, eccentricity, or misalignment between the motor shaft and associated load shaft. During the erection stage adequate precaution and surveillance must be exercised to restrict any misalignment between shafts within the recommended limit. iv. Off-normal voltage"

During the erection stage adequate precaution and surveillance must be exercised to restrict any misalignment between shafts within the recommended limit. iv. Off-normal voltage quality: in the event the supplied voltage is abnormally high or low, the motor will suffer high losses. Too low a voltage may cause a motor to stall. Hence, operators must ensure that variation in supplied voltage to running motor remains within 610% of rated voltage, and frequency remains within 65% of the rated frequency. v. Phase loss: this fault may occur whenever fuses in the supply line blow. Consequently, thermal overload relays operate and trip the motor circuit breaker. vi. Mechanical overload: this fault may cause overheating or even stalling the motor. In this case thermal overload relays also operate to protect the motor.

CHAPTER 14 Air Pollution Control 14.1 INTRODUCTION The problem of air pollution may be the worst curse of modern civilization. With the advent of industrialization human beings started to release more effluent into the atmosphere than nature could handle. Air pollution occurs when chemicals, fumes, particulate matter, odor, or biological materials introduced into air exceed safe limits and cause harm to the health of humans, animals, and other living organisms or dam- age to plants and inanimate objects. These materials can be in the form of solid parti- cles, liquid droplets, or gases and are called pollutants. Pollutants, which are directly emitted from a plant or motor vehicles to atmosphere, e.g., ash, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, or carbon monoxide, are called primary pollutants, while secondary pollutants result from interaction or chemical reaction of primary pollutants, e.g., for- mation of smog or depletion of stratospheric ozone layer. Air pollutants are dispersed throughout the world’s atmosphere in concentrations high enough to gradually cause serious health problems. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen diox- ide, and droplets containing solutions of sulfuric acid, sulphate, and nitrate"

Air pollutants are dispersed throughout the world’s atmosphere in concentrations high enough to gradually cause serious health problems. Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen diox- ide, and droplets containing solutions of sulfuric acid, sulphate, and nitrate salts descend to the earth’s surface in wet form as rain or snow and in dry form as fog, dew, or solid particles. This phenomenon is generally called acid rain. Air pollutants released from fossil fuel power plants include: Particulate matter Particulate matter (PM) or more precisely suspended particu- late matter (SPM) are fine solid particles suspended in a gas. Particulate matter is either naturally available in the atmosphere or can be manmade. Combustion of fossil fuels in power plants generates significant amounts of particulate matter. When the presence of these fine particles in air exceeds a safe limit (Table 14.1 and Table 14.2) these particles cause health hazards. Long-term exposure to particulate matter results in heart disease, risk of decreased lung function, exacerbation of asthma, lungcancer,etc. Carbon dioxide (CO ) Carbon dioxide (CO ) is one of the major pollutants in 2 2 the atmosphere, but it is vital to living organisms. The major source of CO into the 2 atmosphere is combustion of fossil fuels.

Greenhouse gases absorbandemitradiationfromtheatmospherewithinthethermalinfraredrange. Carbon dioxide is a good transmitter of sunlight, but partially restricts infrared radiation going back from the earth into space. This produces the so-called green- house effect that prevents cooling of the earth during the night and keeps the earth warm enough to support human, plant, and animal life. However, incessant release of manmade CO to the atmosphere is so alarming that the concentration of CO since 2 2 the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (taken as the year 1750) has increased by about 43%, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2015 [1], in spite of continuous reduction of atmospheric concentration of CO by photosynthesis. This in turn has 2 reinforced the warming of the earth’s surface further beyond the tolerable limit of earthly objects, both animate and inanimate. The Intergovernmental Panel on 482 ThermalPowerPlant Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted an average global increase in temperature of 1.4K to 5.8K between 1990 and 2100. Carbon monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide is generated when there is incom- plete combustion of fuel. It is colorless and odorless, but is a very poisonous gas. However, due to the high efficiency of present-day steam generators, emission of car- bon monoxide from power plants is not of much of a concern. When inhaled, carbon monoxide enters the bloodstream and disrupts the supply of oxygen to the body’s tissues, the results of which may become fatal if the CO concen- tration becomes 1000ppm or more. Sulfur oxides (SO ) All fossil fuels, i.e., coal, oil, and natural gas, contain sulfur, x and/or sulfur compounds. Sulfur in coal exists in three forms: organic, pyritic and sul- fate. Sulfur that is an inherent constituent of coal is organic sulfur, which is considered as a non-removable impurity. Pyritic sulfur, also known as inorganic sulfur, occurs pri- marily as pyrite or mercasite. Sulfate sulfur usuallyexists in the form of calcium sulfate or iron sulfate. The sulfates represent a small fraction of the total sulfur in coal and have no significant role in the combustion process itself or in contributing to emis- sions. During combustion, both organic sulfur and pyrite are oxidized to sulfur diox-"

During combustion, both organic sulfur and pyrite are oxidized to sulfur diox- ide (SO ). Depending on combustion conditions, a small amount of sulfur trioxide 2 (SO ) may also be formed. Sulfur oxides in combination with moisture content of 3 flue gas form acids (sulfuric acid: H SO ) that may get deposited when combustion 2 4 gas is cooled below its dew-point temperature, resulting in corrosion of air heaters, economizers, downstream flue-gas path, and stacks. Sulfur also contributes to clinker- ing and slagging and to spontaneous combustion of stored coal. In the absence of a suitable emission control process SO , mainly SO , escapes to x 2 the atmosphere. Sulfur oxides emitted from the stack cause acid rain. Sufficiently high concentrations (10ppm) of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere irritates the upper respi- ratory tract of human beings and causes wheezing, breathing problems, exacerbation of asthma, etc. Hence, the use of sulfur-bearing fuels as a power source is a concern.

Figure 14.1 shows how the primary energy demand is growing year after year. Therefore, with the growth of the industry, it is essential to take measures to help prevent air pollution. Air pollution is so critical today that the feasibility of installing any new industry depends on the findings of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study along with any remedial measures proposed.

The mechanical separating device includes gravity settling, cyclone separation, scrubbers, fabric filters, etc. The electric separating device refers to electrostatic precipitation. An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is one of the most widely used air pollution control devices since mechanical separating devices, barring bag filter, are unable to collect fine particles. Both ESP and bag filters are capable of collecting very fine particles from 10μ down to 0.05μ size, with the highest collection efficiency over a wide range of con- taminants as is evident from Figure 14.2. They can be used in applications where there is a large volume of contaminants. The performance of a bag filter is as reliable as an ESP and provides almost identical collection efficiency.

The first is comprised of rows of electrically grounded vertical parallel plates, called collecting electrodes, betweenwhichthegastobecleanedflows.Thesecondsetofelectrodesiswires,called discharge electrodes, are centrally located between each pair of parallel plates. These electrodes may be of different shape and design. Figure 14.6 shows different types of collectingelectrodes,whileFigure14.7presentsvarioustypesofdischargeelectrodes. The wires carry a unidirectional, negatively charged, high-voltage DC current from an external source that generates unidirectional, non-uniform electric field. In a non-uniform electric field, the field intensity near the conductor is considerably higher than that on the periphery or on the plate. Therefore, as the voltage increases, the ionization takes place about the conductor. No ionization takes place near the periphery or on the plate. When the voltage is high enough, a blue luminous glow, called a corona, is produced around them. The corona is an indication of generation of negatively charged gas ions that travel from wires to the grounded collecting electro- des as a result of strong electric field between them. The field intensity that causes the corona to start may be calculated using the following formula [6]: 488 ThermalPowerPlant Precipitator controls Collecting electrodes Girder support assembly High voltage support system Inlet flow distribution devices Discharge electrode rappers Rigid discharge Collecting electrode electrode frame rappers Figure 14.3 General view with part sectional arrangement of a typical ESP.

Figure14.7 Typesofdischargeelectrodes. insulator is called dielectric. Gases under normal condition are insulators (dielectric), since they comprise electrically neutral atoms and molecules. However, when subjected to the influence of various artificial methods, i.e., X-rays, radioactive emissions, cosmic rays,strong heating, bombardment of gas molecules by rapidly moving electrons or ions, etc.,these gasesget ionized, i.e., splitinto electrons(negative ions) andpositiveions, and becomeconductors.Acombinationofsomeofthefreeelectronsofgaseswiththeir neu- tralgasmoleculesalsoresultsintheformationofnegativeions. Out of all artificial methods of ionization just described, the high-voltage direct- current corona is by far the most effective to ionize gas particles. In this method elec- trodes are connected to a voltage source and produce a non-uniform electric field. AirPollutionControl 491 When gases are passed between these electrodes, the free charges within gases move along lines of forces of the non-uniform electric field. Thus under the influence of strong electric field suspended particles in gas stream migrate toward collecting elec- trodes. On reaching the electrodes, particles release part of their charge and get col- lected. The collected dust is then discharged periodically by rapping and gets collected in storage hoppers. The whole process includes the following steps: a. Charging of suspended particles b. Collection of charged particles in an electric field c. Removal of precipitated matters from collecting electrodes The separation force acting on a particle is given by Coulomb’s law, which states that force is proportional to the product of particle charge and the intensityof the col- lecting field. Hence, F NE(cid:3)q ð14:3Þ C where F 5Force, N C E5Field intensity, V/m q5Particle charge, C (5A(cid:4)s) Although the Coulomb force steers particles to accelerate toward the collecting electrodes, inertial and viscous forces counteract the Coulomb force and oppose the motion of particles. For suspended particles, inertial forces are negligibly small and may be ignored. The viscous force of the gas is governed by Stokes’ law and is expressed by Eq. 14.4. The resultant of the Coulomb force and Stokes (viscous) force determines velocities to be attained by a particle in the precipitation field.

While from Eq. 14.8 it follows that sub-micron par- ticles travel at velocities directly proportional to the field intensity and inversely pro- portional to the gas viscosity, but independent of their size. Since the migration velocity is dictated by gas viscosity, which in turn is directly proportional to gas tem- perature, it may be concluded that the migration velocity is sensitive to changes in gas temperature. 14.2.3 Factors to consider for sizing an ESP Sizing of an ESP is determined by various factors or parameters, discussed in the fol- lowing sections. The more accurate the values of these parameters can be predicted during the design stage the better performance of an ESP is expected in the field. Hence, the more the field feedback data available on the performance of a particular design of ESP, the more accurate these parameters can be predicted at the design stage that will ensure better performance of similar design of ESPs in future. Eventually the design of an ESP is more of an art than a science. A single parameter, which is to be judiciously assumed prior to sizing an ESP, is effective migration velocity (EMV), which influences the collection efficiency of an AirPollutionControl 493 ESP. Deutsch(cid:1)Anderson in 1922 developed the following formula for predicting the collection efficiencyof an ESP, n o η5 12e 2 1 w 0 f 0 (cid:3)100 ð14:9Þ where η5Collection efficiencyof ESP, % e5Base of natural logarithm w5Effective migration or drift velocity (EMV), cm/s f5Specific collection area (SCA), m2/m3/s (5collecting electrode surface area, m2, divided by actual volumetric wet gas flow,m3/s) From"

In the 1970s, a modified version of the Deutsch(cid:1)Anderson equation, known as the Matts(cid:1)Ohnfeldt equation, was developed to predicting better performance of an ESP. The modified equation is (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:6) η5 12e 2 w 10 k 0 f k (cid:3)100; ð14:10Þ where η5Collection efficiencyof ESP, % e5Base of natural logarithm w 5Apparent migrationvelocity, cm/s k f5Specific collection area (SCA), m2/m3/s, (as in Eq. 14.9) k5Constant (the value of power “k” varies from 0.4 to 0.6, but is normally 0.5) 14.2.4 Effective migration velocity (EMV), w From field experience it has been established that it is easier to collect larger particles than smaller particles, and the collection efficiency of an ESP decreases with a drop in particle size. Therefore, based on experimental studies the collection efficiency of an ESP at various operating conditions as well as for particle sizes ranging larger than 1μ to sub-micron an overall effective migration velocity is estimated. The value of effec- tive migrationvelocity is a measure of ease or difficultyof collection. Asexplainedearlier,themigrationvelocityisdeterminedbythemagnitudeofparti- cle size, the strength of electric field and the viscous force or drag of the particle. This theoretical value maybecomeexcessivelyhigh comparedto actualvalue duetouneven gasflow,particlediffusion,electricwind,particlechargingtime,andre-entrainment. Hence, during design stage, some characteristics/values of these factors are assumed to arrive at an acceptable effective migrationvelocity, which may get reduced significantly during actual operation. In practice actual migration velocity may deviate considerably from that estimated at design stage, which is usually based on empirical observations. In view of this, it is safe to select a low value of effective migration velocity, and even more so, for handling high resistivity fly ash (Table 14.6), since the migrationvelocity declines as resistivity increases (Figure 14.8).

The value of the SCA depends on physical, chemical, and electrical characteristics of the dust. Table 14.7 summarizes some typical values of SCA for different resistivityof fly ash. In addition to the EMVand SCA other factors that influence ESP sizing are: 1. Aspect ratio 2. Number of fields in series 3. Length of a field 4. Treatment time 5. Electrode spacing 6.

As a result dust carryover to stack will increase. For good design,adesignershouldbecomfortablewithanaspectratioofESPof2.5or more. 14.2.7 Number of fields in series To enhance the reliability of ESP performance, the longitudinal electrical section of gas flow path is divided into a number of independent electric fields. In practice a number of electric fields in series should be no less than 7, in case ash resistivity is too high number of fields in series can be even 9. With this arrangement, the ESP 496 ThermalPowerPlant performance would not be impaired much, even with the loss of one electric field, particularly in the case of handling high resistivity ash. The more the number of fields within a given longitudinal section, the smaller the size of each section, which in turn will provide the following advantages: a. Electrode alignment and spacing are more accurate b. Smaller rectifier sets needed that are inherently more stable under sparking conditions c. Outage of one or two sections has smaller effect on collecting efficiency 14.2.8 Length of a field The time required by each particle to migrate to collecting electrode from discharge electrode determines the length of a field of precipitator passage in the direction of gas flow. This migration time has to be less than the passage time of each particle while passing through a field of precipitator with the same velocity as gas for ensuring effective removal of PM in a field vis-a`-vis and ESP. The length of a field of precipita- tor thus is ensured by [7]: s L # ð14:10Þ w V g or V L$s g ð14:11Þ w where s5Distance between discharge and collecting electrodes, m w5Effective migrationvelocity, m/s L5Length of a field, m V 5Gas velocity, m/s g 14.2.9 Treatment time The time taken by a particle to pass through the total"

For a good design the value of treatment time varies between 25 and 35s for low-sulfur, low-sodium coals and between 7 and 20s for high-sulfur, high-sodium coals [8]. 14.2.10 Electrode spacing Electrode spacing is double the gap between discharge electrodes and collecting electrodes, which means the gap between two parallel collecting electrodes. The electrode spacing considerably influences the migration velocity. For constant AirPollutionControl 497 current density and field strength, an increase in electrode spacing facilitates choos- ing a higher migration velocity as is clear from Table 14.6. As a result, the total collection area is reduced substantially to achieve the desired collection efficiency, which is obvious from Eq. 14.9; thus the total capital expenditure gets reduced. A decrease in electrode spacing would result in lower migration velocity, resulting in higher capital expenditure. To meet today’s stringent pollution control regulations, the efficiency of an ESP has to be very high, about 99.98% or more, for handling high resistivity ash. Thus, from an economical perspective industry practice is to provide electrode spacing of the order of 300/350/400/450/500mm [9]. 14.2.11 Automatic voltage control The collection efficiency of an ESP is determined by the precipitation voltage poten- tial between the discharge electrode and collecting plate. The maximum precipitator efficiency may be achieved by maintaining the operating voltage in the individual field of the precipitator below, but close to the flashover limit (the point of sparking between discharge electrodes and collecting plates that switches off the plant). Further, as the flashover voltage varies with operating conditions of the precipitator, such as gas volume, dust content, gas composition, gas temperature, humidity, etc., continuous adjustment of precipitation voltage according to prevailing operating con- ditions is needed. Therefore, in order to avoid the frequent readjustment and possible trip-outs on manually operated sets, operating personnel often reduce the voltage and current to much lower than the flashover limit. Automatic voltage control works in two steps: first, the voltage is gradually raised at a pre-set rate until flashover takes place and switches off the system. Then after a pre-set time delay, the system switches on automatically and the voltage is raised to slightly reduced level than the flashover limit. Thereafter, this mode of cycle gets repeated continuously. 14.2.12 Transformer rectifier (T/R) set The high-voltage power needed to discharge the electrode system is supplied by a transformer rectifier set along with"

Two transformer rectifier sets are nor- mally needed to power each precipitator field. In practice a medium voltage AC sup- ply is regulated and transformed into a nominal voltage of 50(cid:1)120kV, rectified to a negative DC output then supplied to the discharge electrode system. The current density usually is maintained over a range of 0.25(cid:1)0.45mA/m2, from which the capacity of transformer rectifier set can be determined, since the collecting area of each field is already known. 498 ThermalPowerPlant 14.2.13 Hopper heating and storage volume In practice, dust collected near hopper walls will agglomerate and plug the dust- removing system. Hopper heating arrangement prevents formation of dust cakes and gets rid of the hopper plugging problem. Additionally, the bottom part of the hopper is sometimes provided with a stainless steel liner that ensures satisfactory flow of dust from it. Fluidizing pads are also fitted inside hoppers to ensure smooth flowof dust. The dust hoppers must have adequate storage capacity to hold all the collected dust at a boiler maximum generating condition of the unit while firing the worst coal. An overfill hopper may result in loss of an electrical section. Therefore, the hop- per storage volume should be adequate enough such that during the interval between two consecutive steps of removal of dust from the hopper usually (6(cid:1)8 hrs) as per the industry practice, dust build-up will not bridge the high voltage frame. 14.2.14 Rapping mechanism When dust builds up on plates, it deposits in a layer of increasing thickness with possi- ble re-entry into the gas flow path, hence build-up ash needs to be removed periodi- cally by hitting/rapping collecting electrodes with hammers. Based on the changing characteristics and collection rates of dust the intensity and frequency of rapping of individual collection plates varies from inlet to outlet of precipitator. Rapping should be carried out sequentially so that only a fraction of accumulated dust is disturbed at anyone time. There are two types of hammers: drop hammer and tumbling hammer. Drop hammers are either pneumatically driven or electrically driven. Each drop hammer is connected with a number of electrodes and is used to rap from the top of electrodes. Tumbling hammers are basically side hammers where a set of hammers is mounted on a hori- zontal shaft in a staggered fashion. As the shaft rotates one hammer at a time tumbles and hit a shock bar.

As the shaft rotates one hammer at a time tumbles and hit a shock bar. Excessive rapping of collecting electrodes is detrimental to the performance of an ESP as it causes re-entrainment of collected dust and reduces the life of internal com- ponents. In contrast, inadequate rapping results in build-up of a dielectric dust layer on the collecting plates, which is penetrated by corona current. As a result the dust layer reaches a level of resistivity that generates ionization or back-corona and causes dust particles to become positively charged and move toward negative high voltage discharge electrodes. Thus, localized excessive sparking occurs, reducing power input to the ESP, which in turn lowers the collection efficiency. 14.2.15 Factors that affect performance of ESP The factors that determine the type, size, and efficiency of the electrostatic precipita- tor are discussed in following sections. During normal running if any of these factors varies substantially from the design, the performance of the ESP will be jeopardized, which may lead toviolating a local SPM emission regulation. i.

Basic properties of the gas and dust particles ix. Disposal of collected gas 14.2.16 Volume of gas flow The volume of gas to be treated is usually determined at the design stage of any proj- ect. Subsequently, if it is found that the actual volume of gas to be handled is much higher than the specified volume of gas, the following detrimental effects on ESP per- formance could be encountered: (cid:129) Achieved efficiency would reduce (Figure 14.9) (cid:129) Re-entrainment loss would increase (cid:129) Ash burden to hopper would increase (cid:129) Emission rate of SPM would increase. 100.0 99.9 99.8 99.7 99.6 99.5 99.4 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 Volume of gas flow (%) )%( ycneiciffe noitcelloC AirPollutionControl 499 Figure14.9 Collectionefficiencyversusvolumeofgasflow. 500 ThermalPowerPlant 14.2.17 Velocity of gas flow This is a critical design parameter and is calculated by dividing the actual volume flow rate of gas by the cross-sectional area of the precipitator. For low-sulfur, low-sodium coals, the gas velocity may be in the range of 0.5(cid:1)1m/s, and for high-sulfur, high- sodium coals, the gas velocity could be as high as 1.5m/s [8].

At velocities greater than that, problems of re-entrainment of suspended particles are aggravated. 14.2.18 Temperature of flue gas Temperature of flue gases passing through precipitator will affect the collectability of ash and removal of collected ash from collecting plates. When this temperature reaches the dew-point temperature moisture will form and cause dust particles to solidify into cakes. Further build up of these cakes may result in short-circuits or wire failures. In contrast, if the flue-gas temperature exceeds a high limit, then the gas volume will increase, leading to a reduction in collection efficiency. At higher temperature, the viscosity of the gas also increases, resulting in high viscous drag with an additional reduction in collection efficiency. 14.2.19 Gas distribution While flowing through the precipitator the distribution of gas must be uniform all along its path, from the inlet up to its outlet. In sections where velocity is high, ash may be swept off collector plates and can show up in the stack as a visible plume, while at low velocity sections, although gas is more efficiently cleaned, the effect will be a reduction in overall collection efficiency. Hence, proper devices, e.g., perforated distribution plates, turning vanes, and baffles in the precipitator inlet and duct work, should be installed to prevent uneven gas distribution. 14.2.20 Dust resistivity The electrostatic precipitator is very sensitive to the resistivity of ash or dust deposited on collecting plates. Experience has shown that coal ashes with resistivity between 108 and 231010ohm-cm is normal for satisfactory and predictable precipitator design. Resistivity of ash that exceeds this limit becomes highly resistive to dust collection. The presence of constituents, such as SiO , 2 Al O , CaO, etc., in fly ash causes high resistivity of ash that does not readily 2 3 lose its charge when collected on plates, and the agglomerated ash is very difficult to get removed. When deep-enough deposits collect on the plate, back-corona (local sparking on dust layer) develops, causing the collection rate to reduce (Figure 14.10). A corona discharge occurs only in an inhomogeneous electric field with the electrodes definitely shaped and located [6]. 100.0 99.9 99.8 99.7 99.6 99.5 99.4 9×1012 1×1013 2×1013 3×1013 4×1013 5×1013 6×1013 The resistivity of ash is lowered by cooling the inlet gas to the ESP while simulta- neously increasing the water vapor content or by introducing SO , NH , etc., into 3 3 the flue gas. These additives are adsorbed onto fly ash particles and produce an electri- cally conductive surface condition, improving precipitation.

Experimental results reveal that resistivity of ash is maximum at around 423K (Figure 14.11). 14.2.21 Inlet dust concentration At the time of design certain dust concentration at inlet to the ESP is determined. If this concentration changes during operation, there will be consequent change in dust collection efficiency (Figure 14.12). 14.2.22 Weight of dust per unit volume of gas During the design stage the expected weight of fly ash per unit time may be calcu- lated, considering analysis of a worst coal.

A coal with lower sulfur content may give satisfactory separation when the flue-gas temperature is increased.

The optical properties of particles are of great importance in connection with gas cleaning and air pollution, because the degree of pollution is commonly judged by visual appearance of stack discharge. 14.2.24 Disposal of collected gas An ESP is enclosed and insulated.

Depending on the temperature of the entering flue-gas the type of fabric material may be any one of Polypropylene (PP), Polyester (PES), Draylon T (PAC), Ryton (PPS), Nomex (APA), P84 (PI), Teflon (PTFE), Fiber glass (GLS), etc [4]. Of these materials, from an economical perspective, the most suitable one for handling fossil fuel-fired flue gas is Ryton, which can withstand a flue-gas temperature up to 453K. AirPollutionControl 505 14.2.25.1 Principle of operation of a bag filter On entering the baghouse, dust-burdened flue gas strikes a baffle plate, where larger dust particles fall by gravity (Figure 14.4). This partially cleaned dirty gas then enters each bag and leaves as clean gas from the top of the bag. PM adheres to the surface of cloth as cake and gets accumulated. These accumulated cakes are cleaned periodically by applying pulse-jet or reverse-jet air flow and get collected in hoppers. Dust particles collected in hoppers are removed periodically by a fly ash-handling system. The cakes may also be cleaned by shaking or rapping of bags. 14.2.26 Factors to consider for sizing a bag filter Three factors that affect the sizing of bag filters are: i.

Emission Rate: This is the emission limit that is to be complied with in line with the recommendation of local environmental control authority. 14.2.27 Factors that affect the performance of the bag filter In addition to the air/cloth ratio other factors that may affect the efficiency of a bag filter are as follows: i. Material of Fabric: Material selected should be capable of withstanding the maxi- mum flue-gas temperature during operation, of resisting abrasion and of with- standing any chemical attack ii.

Even in countries where natural gas is abundantly available, coal-fired stations are attractive, since the cost of natural gas is exorbi- tantly high compared to the cost of coal. This is in spite of the fact that emission of CO (which is a major greenhouse gas as explained earlier) per kWh from a 2 coal-fired station is almost twice the amount emitted from a natural-gas-based combined cycle power plant. Therefore, in order to reduce CO emissions from 2 coal-fired power plants it is important that these plants produce power more effi- ciently. A study reveals that in a 660MW power station, firing typical Indian coal, a gain in plant efficiency by 3% would result in reduction in CO emissions by 2 about 6% per kWh [12]. Hence, to achieve lower CO emissions, coal-fired utility power plants should 2 choose larger unit sizes and higher steam parameters. Eventually power plants AirPollutionControl 507 operating with supercritical steam conditions play a vital role over sub-critical plants. In addition to efficient operation and less generation of CO the added advantage of 2 using supercritical technology is to emit less SO and NO . X X Another option to mitigate CO emissions is to adopt an “integrated gasification 2 combined cycle” (IGCC) process for power generation. Since the IGCC process does not fall under the discussion of conventional thermal power plant, this chapter refrains from elaborating IGCC further. (Detailed treatment of supercritical power plants was presented in Section 2.10, Chapter 2, Steam Generators). 14.4 METHODS OF SO EMISSION CONTROL X According to the guidelines laid out in the U.S. “Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)” of 1990, SO emission from a coal-fired power plant stack to atmosphere is 2 controlled by adopting anyone or combination of following two methods [13]: i. Switching over to low sulfur fuel ii. Installing flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) system During the initial stage, coal switching became more attractive to the utilities because of the cost of complying with the CAAA mandate. Subsequently it was real- ized by utilities that switching to low sulfur coal in existing boilers lead to various problems, as discussed in the following, since by and large low sulfur coals are low- ranking coals with higher ash content and lower heating value: 1.

The capacity of existing ash-handling system was inadequate for complete evacua- tion of ash generated Utilities, however, observed that fuel switchover was only amenable for adoption in retrofit projects. Eventually FGD became attractive and continues to control SO 2 emission through stacks of pulverized coal-fired boilers to comply with local pollution control regulations in each nation. SO gas is acidic in nature and hence chemicals that may be used to remove SO 2 2 from flue gases must be alkaline, i.e., limestone (CaCO ), hydrated lime {Ca(OH) }, 3 2 magnesium hydroxide {Mg(OH) }, etc. A natural alkaline that may be used to absorb 2 SO is seawater. 2 508 ThermalPowerPlant Based on experience an FGD system can be classified into seven categories as dis- cussed in the following sections. 14.4.1 Wet scrubber A wet scrubber may be used for boiler applications with high- to low-sulfur coals. This is the most widely used FGD technology for SO control. In wet scrubbers flue 2 gas enters at the bottom of an absorber tower and exits as clean gas from the top. Both absorption and oxidation take place within the absorber tower. Water is sprayed at the top of the tower through a series of spray nozzles and air is injected through the tower from the bottom at a point lower than the entry point of flue gas. A slurry mixture of calcium-, sodium-, and ammonium-based sorbents, prepared in an external container, is injected into the tower to react with the SO in the flue gas. From a 2 techno-economic consideration sorbent that is widely used in operating wet scrubbers is limestone (CaCO ). Next preferred sorbent is lime (CaO). Figure 14.13 shows the 3 schematic arrangement of a typical wet scrubber system. Limestone units generally operate in a forced-oxidation mode producing gypsum as a by-product. In this mode limestone reacts with SO in flue gas producing calcium 2 sulphite (CaSO ). The injected air along with air contained in flue gas first oxidizes 3 calcium sulphite producing calcium sulphate (CaSO ), which in the next step reacts 4 with incoming sprayed water to produce gypsum (CaSO (cid:4)2H O). The correspond- 4 2 ing chemical reactions are: CaCO 1SO 5CaSO 1CO 3 2 3 2 CaSO 11/O 12H O5CaSO (cid:4)2H O 3 2 2 2 4 2 In a magnesium-enhanced wet lime process, about 4(cid:1)7% (by weight) of magne- sium oxide (MgO) is added to quick lime (CaO).

Source: http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/ Flue_gas_desulfurization. 14.4.3 Sorbent injection system A sorbent injection system is the simplest method of SO removal from flue gas. 2 Sorbent generally used in this system are limestone (CaCO ), dolomite 3 (CaCO (cid:4)MgCO ), lime (CaO), or hydrated lime (Ca(OH) ). Based on location of 3 3 2 injection of sorbent, this system is classified into furnace sorbent injection (FSI), econ- omizer sorbent injection (ESI), duct sorbent injection (DSI) (Figure 14.14), and hybrid sorbent injection (HSI) process. In all these types the effectiveness of SO 2 removal depends on how evenly and quickly the sorbent is sprayed across the cross- section of flue-gas stream. The solid waste obtained downstream of each process is removed in the dust-collecting equipment. In a furnace/post furnace sorbent injection system (FSI) powdered dry sorbent (usually limestone or hydrated lime) is sprayed into the entire cross-section in the upper part of the furnace, where the temperature is maintained above 1023K but not more than 1523K. When flue gas passes through this zone the SO and O content of the flue 2 2 gas reacts with the sorbent to form CaSO . 4 The SO removal efficiency that may be attained in FSI is 50% or higher based on 2 even distribution of sorbent, fastness of application, ensuring optimum residence time (1 to 2 seconds), maintaining proper sorbent particle size (not more than 5μ, but preferably less than 3μ) and adopting Ca:S ratio between 2 and 3. Sorbent used in an economizer sorbent injection process (ESI) is hydrated lime. When flue gas flows through the economizer zone its temperature remains between 573K and 923K. At this temperature range when sorbent is sprayed into the flue-gas stream Ca(OH) reacts with SO to produce CaSO instead of CaSO . 2 2 3 4 512 ThermalPowerPlant In a duct sorbent injection (DSI) process sorbent is sprayed into"

Along with the sorbent some water may also be sprayed to humidify the flue gas with the precaution that humidityalways remains above the dew point. SO removal efficiencyof this pro- 2 cess could be as high as 80%. Adopting FSI in combination with DSI is called a hybrid sorbent injection (HSI) pro- cess. This combination results in higher sorbent utilization and greater SO removal. 2 With humidification SO removal efficiencyof HSI can be boosted up to 90%. 2 14.4.4 Dry scrubber A circulating fluidized bed (CFB) involves a scrubbing technology known as a dry scrubber process. In this process, hydrated lime, limestone, or dolomite and water are intimately mixed with flue gas in a dedicated reaction chamber, which is the fuel- firing bed. Reacted solids get dried completely by the sensible heat of the flue gas. The process is easy to maintain and operate since it does not include high- maintenance mechanical equipment. The process can achieve about 95% SO removal 2 efficiency. Because of high SO removal efficiency the Ca:S ratio (1.2(cid:1)1.5) of the dry 2 scrubber process is less than that of the sorbent injection system. (For more informa- tion, refer to Section 5.4, in Chapter 5, Fluidized Bed Combustion Boilers.) 14.4.5 Regenerable process InaregenerableprocessSO removalefficiencyisveryhigh(.95%),buttheprocesssuf- 2 fers from high cost and high power consumption.

AirPollutionControl 513 14.4.7 Seawater FGD Seawater FGD is attractive to plants that are located near coastlines. Seawater is a source of natural alkalinity that can be used economically to arrest SO from flue gas 2 without the use of anyother supplemental reagents. Seawater contains significant con- centrations of alkaline ions including sodium, magnesium, potassium, calcium, carbo- nates, and bicarbonates. It also contains significant concentrations of chloride and sulphite ions. Desulfurization is accomplished by seawater scrubbing, and 90% SO 2 removal efficiency could be achieved by adopting this process. Before entering into the seawater scrubber flue gas is cooled to its adiabatic satura- tion temperature of typically 365K. The scrubber is packed with certain material pro- prietary in nature through which flue gas flows from the bottom and seawater is sprayed counter-current to the flow of flue gas in order to achieve effective SO mass 2 transfer and chemical absorption into the liquid phase. Thus, SO in the flue gas is 2 absorbed and converted to sulphite first. Sulphite is further oxidized to produce sul- phate for safe disposal to the sea without jeopardizing the marine environment. For disposal of liquid effluent to sea, it should be ensured that liquid effluent is alkaline with a pH no less than 8. 14.5 METHODS OF NO EMISSION CONTROL X Oxides of nitrogen are generally referred to as NO , comprising both nitric oxide x (NO) and nitrous oxide (NO ). During the combustion of fossil fuel in a conven- 2 tional boiler NO is formed of which NO accounts for 90(cid:1)95% and the remainder is x NO . NO is formed in the flame-zone vicinity by oxidation of nitrogen content of 2 x air (thermal NO ) and nitrogen content of fuel (fuel NO ) as well as by oxidation of x x intermediate hydrocarbons present in flames (prompt NO ). The average temperature x in the vicinity of the flame zone is about 1477K with a peak temperature as high as about 1922K. The direct high-temperature reaction of atmospheric nitrogen with oxygen results in thermal NO . If the combustion temperature can be reduced by supplying less x combustion air production rate of thermal NO will drop.

However, it is important in gas-turbine power x plants where ultra-high level emission is considered. NO is harmful in several ways (cid:1) as a contributor to acid rain, as a destroyer of x the ozone layer, and as a heat-trapping compound suspected of increasing atmospheric temperatures. At lowelevations, NO also reacts with sunlight to create smog. x Refractory quarl Pneumatic cylinder for air slide retraction Primary air swirler Low NOx baffles To control NO emissions from fossil-fuel-fired combustors, in accordance with x the US Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), alternative techniques that are made available to utilities are use of low-NO burners (LNB), or adopting fuel bias- x ing, or limiting the excess-air (LEA) in the combustion process, or application of over-fire air (OFA), or injecting steam or water into the flame, or recirculating flue gases. All these techniques seek redistribution of air and fuel, causing slow mixing of air and fuel, reduction of O level in critical NO formation zones, and lowering of 2 x the amount of fuel burned at peak flame temperature. Other techniques that are avail- able are back-end controls like selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non- catalytic reduction (SNCR) systems [14]. The following sections discuss the techniques that are usually adopted. 14.5.1 Burner replacement This method is normally adopted for retrofitting purposes.

Char oxidizing zone Use of LNBs, however, suffers from generating higher carbon loss in ash. The burner replacement method in isolation can not meet present-day emission level norm. To make this method effective LNBs are combined with combustion modifica- tion as discussed in the following. 14.5.2 Combustion modification In order to ensure complete combustion with reduced NO emission, control of fuel x and air supply is very important. This is accomplished at the burner as well as inside the furnace. Supplyof secondaryair and over-fire air facilitates vertical staged combus- tion. While supply of air at different points along the flame or introducing tertiary air at the burner ensures horizontal staging of combustion. In addition to the above replacement of burners, adjustable angle over-fire air (OFA) dampers are also installed to quench flue-gas temperature, minimizing forma- tion of NO . Furnace over-fire air helps in separating combustion air into primary x and secondary air to achieve complete combustion. The primary air combines with fuel that produces a relatively low-temperature fuel-rich zone. Then the secondary air is introduced above the burners to complete the combustion also at a relatively low temperature. Thus, N is produced in lieu of NO . The effectiveness of controlling 2 x NO formation by providing OFA dampers has already been “proven.” x Flue-gas recirculation, like over-fire air, quenches the flame and at the same time reduces oxygen level, thereby NO formation is minimized. x Use of low excess air in the combustion region and then re-burning fuel-rich mixture above this region provides fuel staging. Fuel staging can also be achieved by taking the burner out of service (BOOS). This technique, however, is seldom prac- ticed in pulverized coal-fired boilers. Fuel biasing is another method of fuel staging. In this method, the fuel supply is shifted from the upper-level burners to"

This technique, however, is seldom prac- ticed in pulverized coal-fired boilers. Fuel biasing is another method of fuel staging. In this method, the fuel supply is shifted from the upper-level burners to the lower levels or from central burners to burners located in the periphery. These types of arrangements create a fuel-rich zone in the lower level and peripheral burners and fuel-lean zone in the upper and central burners. As a result, the flame temperature is reduced, minimizing the formation of NO , and at the same time, improving the bal- x ance of oxygen concentration in the furnace. NO formation is inherently minimized in furnaces with large cross-sections. x Furnaces that are designed for high heat release rates are susceptible to high NO x emissions, since an air-in leakage can quickly counter weigh low NO gain. The fun- x damental concept of low-temperature fluidized bed firing yields low NO emissions. x (For additional information refer to Chapter 5, Fluidized Bed Combustion Boilers.) AirPollutionControl 517 The disadvantages of combustion modification method are: i. It requires constant operator attention or a high degree of automatic control ii.

This technique is mainly adopted in gas turbines. The added benefit of adopting this technique is a boost in power output as a result of greater mass flow. This technique, however, demands ultra-pure water, since even a minute presence of alkali in the combustor may destruct the gas turbine operating at an inlet temperature of 1423K or above. 14.5.4 Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) In the SCR process ammonia vapor is used as a reducing agent. This vapor is injected into the flue-gas stream in the presence of a catalyst, thereby converting NO into x H O and N. In the absence of a catalyst these reactions take place at temperatures 2 between 1143 and 1478K, but in the presence of a suitable catalyst these reactions may take place at much lower temperatures of 573(cid:1)673K, normally prevalent at the economizer outlet.

SCR system can accomplish over an 80% reduction of NO X from flue gases [14]. In coal-fired power plants, the SCR system is placed in three typical locations: between ESP and FGD in low dust configuration (Figure 14.18) or between econo- mizer and air heater in a high dust system, especially with dry bottom boilers (Figure 14.19), or after the FGD (Figure 14.20), primarily with wet bottom boilers with ash recirculation to avoid catalyst degradation. 14.5.5 Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) In the SNCR process a reagent, i.e., urea, ammonium hydroxide, anhydrous ammo- nia, or aqueous ammonia, is injected into flue gases in the furnace within the appro- priate temperature zone, typically in the range of 1173(cid:1)1373K [14]. The NO and x the reagent (urea, etc.) react to form N and H O and do not require a catalyst. The 2 2 process is relatively simple, but highly sensitive to ammonia slip.

Generally, it is difficult to use SNCR in larger fossil-fired furnaces x and in gas turbines, but it is widelyapplied to fluidized-bed-boilers in cases where fur- ther reduction of NO from flue gases is needed. x SNCR is an ideal retrofit technology and is compatible with other techniques (i.e., low- NO burners, OFA, FGR, gas reburning, etc.). Along with combustion x modification, SNCR facilitates even higher reduction of NO . x The major disadvantage of the SNCR process is that it has a tendency to produce nitrous oxide (N O), which propagates the greenhouse effect. 2 14.6 REDUCTION OF MERCURY EMISSION Mercury emission from coal-fired power plants to the"

Mercury is emitted from coal-fired power plants in three different forms: mercury oxides, elemental mercury, and mercury in particu- late form. Mercury oxides are soluble in water, and thus could be captured in wet scrubbers, and the particulate mercury gets separated from flue gases through the col- lecting process in ESPs or bag filters. It is the elemental mercury that may escape to the atmosphere through the stack, but could be mitigated by injecting sorbents such as “powdered activated carbon” (PAC) [15]. From this discussion it is evident that conventional techniques that control other air pollutants, discussed above, in combination (Figure 14.21) can reduce emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants to safe airborne limit.

CHAPTER 15 Codes and Standards for Power Plant Design and Operation 15.1 INTRODUCTION In the most basic sense, codes are laws [1,2]. Any violation of codes, if not followed wherever applicable, can result in legal trouble. Codes are passed by legislature and/or governmental bodies, and under their authority of jurisdictions the right to use the codes is controlled. Codes lay down guidelines to ensure minimum safeguards to the public by regulating specific objectives of a particular subject. They are written byexperts and professionals with knowledge and expertise in a particular field. Let us consider building codes; most countries have their jurisdictions in these codes. Even within a country local authorities, such as municipalities, have their own building codes. They are meant to protect the health, safety, and welfare of future occupants before giving permission to build the residential and commercial buildings. Building codes are laws that tell people what types of buildings can be built in a par- ticular area and what procedures need to be followed to build them in that particular area. These codes also specify even the smallest details for all types of buildings. Since determining such building codes is an arduous task that requires many laborious hours, once they are finalized they are considered as templates for adoption called “model building codes” for the purpose of adoption by various local authorities in a country. The same is true of codes applicable to various fields of engineering, including thermal power plants. When designers, manufacturers, erectors, operators, and users of equipment follow these codes they can confidently and comfortably ensure the safety, security, healthiness, welfare, etc., of plant personnel along with people at large as well as equipment of thermal power plants. Standards are technical documents, produced by recognized authorities, and they are not enforceable by law [1,2]. Standards lay down the guidelines necessary to ensure that products, procedures, or materials are of acceptable quality and fit for their purpose. They provide technical instructions for promoting the safety, reliability, pro- ductivity, and efficiency of equipment or system falling in the scope of various fields of engineering. Standards apply to everything from chalk to cheese, pin to process, tube to turbine, motor to medical equipment, and so on. ThermalPowerPlant r2015ElsevierInc.

Standards can be voluntarily followedtoachievetheminimumlevelsofqualitythatarerespectedinaparticular indus- try. Following a standard procedure the cost of production may be curtailed or down timereduced.Standardizationofvariousproductsalsofacilitatesharnessingthebenefitof interchangeability.Astandardardizedproductisreadilyacceptedinthemarket. Codes and standards can be used repeatedly. They are dynamic documents that are continuously updated to accommodate new ideas, evolutions, inventions, and developments. 15.2 BENEFITS The benefits of adopting a code or a standard include: Benefit 1. If the population of a country uses efficient appliances, that country can enhance the overall efficiency of their national economy. A study a few years back revealed that if improvements in energy efficiency averted 20% of Pakistan’s projected energy demand over the next 25 years, Pakistan would need 10 billion US dollars less for capital investments in power plants, transmission lines, and fuel [3]. Benefit 2. Standards also enhance consumer welfare by boosting energy efficient equipment. Following standard guidelines, the number of consumer appliance models and features available to consumers has increased worldwide with lower than expected impact on prices. The average cost of operating a new consumer appliance has dropped, in spite of enhanced features and increased sizes. Benefit 3. Local businesses may flourish and become more profitable by making efficient equipment and improved products available to the public. Even in the global marketplace local appliances, consumer goods, heavy industrial equipment, etc., of a country would be more competitive and attractive. Benefit 4. By adopting standard products and following standard procedures a country will be in a position to meet climate change goals and reduce urban/regional pollution. Reducing energy consumption decreases both carbon and other emissions from fossil-fueled power plants. 15.3 ISSUING ORGANIZATIONS Standards are issued by a vast multitude of organizations. Most countries have a single standards issuing agency, e.g., the Bureau of Indian Standards in India and the British Standards Institution in the UK, but in the United States voluntary standards are largely the responsibility of industrial associations such as the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials).

They naturally occur, recur, sometimes periodically, do not deplete, are almost inexhaustible, replenished constantly, and are free for the taking [1]. They are also called alternate sources of energy or non-conventional sources of energy. By and large, renewable energy sources, with the exception of biomass, are clean, almost never causing environmental pollution be it thermal, chemical, dust bearing, toxic wastes, or obnoxious gaseous constituents, and sometimes are even noise free. Thus, they are environmentally attractive for replacing conventional fuels, i.e., coal, fuel oil, natural gas, etc., in the area of power generation along with other areas such as fuel in motor vehicles. One particular advantage of utiliz- ing renewable energy in the power sector is that it can substantially reduce green- house gas emissions. As of 2010 about 17% of total worldwide energy consumption is sourced from renewable energy (Figure A.1) [2]. In the power sector, however, renewable energy plays a much bigger role. In 2013 generation of about 22% of worldwide electricity was provided by renewable energy [3]. This trend is encouraging against the backdrop of already depleting fossil fuels, along with ever-increasing rise in fossil fuel prices. The growth of power produced from renewable energy sources up to 2011 is shown in Figure A.2 [2]. While conventional energy sources are found in only a limited number of coun- tries worldwide, renewable energy resources exist in a wide range of areas spreading across many countries globally. If the full potential of renewable energy available in any country could be harnessed it help reduce dependence on costly imported con- ventional fuels. Thus, renewable energy sources could easily be used in rural and remote areas for the generation of electricity, instead of using energy from conven- tional fuels. In 2011 Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said “renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity [4].” 539 300 (1) Renewable power excluding hydro 200 (2) Wind 100 (3) Biomass (4) Solar PV (5) Geothermal 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Year"

If the full potential of this incident energy could be harnessed effectively it would satisfy worldwide energy needs. Notwithstanding such potential, the main drawback of solar energy is it is very diffusing, cyclic, at times undependable, and it doesn’t work at night without a battery-type storage device. It also suffers from atmospheric interference from clouds, particulate matter, gases, etc. To serve a community using )WG( yticapac rewop elbaweneR 540 AppendixA:PowerfromRenewableEnergy RReenneewwaabblleess BBiioommaassss hheeaatt 1111..4444%% SSoollaarr hhoottwwaatteerr 00..1177%% GGeeootthheerrmmaall hheeaatt 00..1122%% HHyyddrrooppoowweerr 33..3344%% EEtthhaannooll 00..5500%% BBiiooddiieesseell 00..1177%% BBiioommaassss eelleeccttrriicciittyy 00..2288%% WWiinndd ppoowweerr 00..5511%% GGeeootthheerrmmaall eelleeccttrriicciittyy 00..0077%% SSoollaarr PPVV ppoowweerr 00..0066%% SSoollaarr CCSSPP 00..000022%% OOcceeaann ppoowweerr 00..000011%% Total world energy Total consumption by Fossil fuels 80.6% source (2010) Renewables 16.7% Nuclear 2.7% FigureA.1 Sourcesofworldwideenergyconsumption[2]. 400 Global renewable power capacities (excluding hydro) data source REN21_renewables global status report (2006–2012) 0 FigureA.2 Growthofapowercapacityfromrenewableenergy,barringhydro[2]. AppendixA:PowerfromRenewableEnergy 541 FigureA.3 Aviewofsolarcollectors[2]. solar energy a vast area of land will be needed to generate enough energy. As a result solar technologies are veryexpensive [1]. Solar radiation may either be converted into thermal or photovoltaic energy to generate electricity. In the thermal type, solar thermal collectors (Figure A.3) [2], which are mirrors, gather the sun’s energy (which spreads over a large area) and focus this distributed energy into a small beam. This high-energy beam is then directed onto receivers containing the working fluid of a thermodynamic cycle to produce mechanical work and electricity. Photovoltaic systems consist of direct-conversion devices in the form of cells made of semiconductor materials. As sunlight hits these cells they convert the solar radiant- energy light photons into electric current using the photoelectric effect and generate electricity. In 2011, the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that “the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer- term benefits.

Since the earth is warmer in the daytime and cooler at night the air above the earth’s surface warms and cools at different rates, causing ripples in air above the earth’s surface, which is called “wind.” Althoughsolarradiationisreceivedacrossthetotalsurfaceoftheearth,itgetsabsorbed inor reflected from surfacesbearingsand, stone, water, etc.Thus, windsare stronger and more consistent in offshore and high altitude sites than those at land. Experience reveals that the average wind speed offshore is about 90% greater than on land. This movement of air or airflow may be used to run wind mills or wind turbines (Figure A.4) [2]. The poweroutputof awindmillvarieswiththewindspeedinaproportioncubeofthewind speed[1].Thus,asmallincreaseinwindspeedcausesasharpriseinpoweroutput. Wind power is pollution-free, i.e., it doesn’t cause air, soil, or water pollution. Its source of energy is free and it is virtually inexhaustible in producing electricity. However, wind power is only suitable in areas with generally steady winds. The first windmill to drive an electric generator was built in the 19th century. A.4 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY Geothermal energy is the natural heat from the core of the earth. This energy may be sourced from shallow ground or the upper 3m deep of the earth’s surface as hot water at a temperature ranging from 283K to 289K to heat and cool buildings. Geothermal energy may be in the form of steam from hot rock found thousands of meters beneath the earth’s surface. The heat has manifested itself for thousands of years. To access this vast source of heat, cold water is injected down one well, circulat- ing it through hot fractured rock, and then hot water is drawn from another well. Thus, the energy is clean and sustainable. AppendixA:PowerfromRenewableEnergy 543 When geothermal energy is spouted as natural steam from the earth it is used to generate electricity in similar way as the energy used in conventional steam power plants having turbo-generators. Electricity is also generated by using the heat from the hot water to boil water in a separate heat exchanger generating steam. Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. The most powerful geothermal energy may also be sourced from an even deeper area into the core of the earth’s surface having extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma. Unfortunately, the available technology is unable to recover this high-temperature energy directly from magma.

As of 2015 the United States is the highest producer of geothermal power in the world with an installed capacity of 3548MW, which is 28% of worldwide geothermal power capacity [6]. There are two types of geothermal power plants: dry steam (Figure A.5) and flash steam types (Figure A.6) [6]. In dry steam type hot water on reaching the surface is vaporized into almost dry steam at a pressure of about 0.8 MPa and temperature of about 423 K(cid:1)488 K. Flash steam stations tap high-pressure hot water from the interior of the earth. When hot water reaches earth’s surface pressure drops to about 0.8 MPa resulting in flashed steam at a temperature ranging from 447 K(cid:1)588 K.

A.5 OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY Seas and oceans absorb solar radiation, resulting in ocean currents and moderate temperature gradients from the water surface to deeper below. Since the surface of water receives direct sunlight it is warmer, but below the surface, it is very cold. This temperature gradient can be used in a heat engine to make energy to generate power [7]. Since the surface temperature varies with latitude and season the temperature difference between the surface and below varies between 15(cid:1)22 K [1] (Figure A.7). Using this type of energy source, which is called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, or OTEC, a large quantum of electrical power in the range of gigawatts could be produced. But to build a power plant of this size large diameter of intake pipe submerged to ocean depth of a kilometer or more would be required. Cost of building such plant would be economically prohibitive. There are three types of OTEC plants: Closed Cycle: InaclosedcycleOTECplantpressurizedwarmsurfacewater ispassed throughaheatexchangerwhereheattransfertakesplacetovaporizealowboilingpoint fluid, such as ammonia (Table A.1). This vapor is then expanded through a turbine to generate electricity.

This steam then operates a low-pressure turbine to generate electricity. The exhaust steam is con- densed by supplying low-temperature water from deep below the surface.

During low tide this water is released and the potential energy of such tidal waves is utilized generate power in the same way as in a OTEC Ocean surface Turbine Vaporizer Condenser Water Water in out 15°C 10°C Pump conventional hydel power plant. The main drawback of this type of plant is that it essentially requires large underwater turbines to generate power (Figure A.9). As a result, the cost of this plant is prohibitively high compared to a river dam hydel power plant. A.7 WAVE ENERGY When wind blows over the surface of oceans large waves with high kinetic energy are generated. This energy is used in turbines to generate power [7]. The working princi- ple of operating such a plant is explained as follows (Figure A.10): i. The incoming wave as it rises inside a chamber forces the air out the chamber and ii. As the air is driven out it rotates a turbine to generate electricity. This type of plant can only be located where wave power has high potential. A.8 HYDRAULIC TURBINE A hydraulic turbine is a machine that converts the potential energy of supplied water into mechanical energy of a rotating shaft, which in turn drives a generator to pro- duce electricity. This type of turbine operates on either the impulse or reaction prin- ciple [8]. Hydraulic turbines can be used for either vertical shaft or horizontal shaft. ertem 0001 – htpeD 546 AppendixA:PowerfromRenewableEnergy Working fluid – ammonia Water in 5°C Figure A.8 Closed cycle OTEC power plant.

The wheel is built in such a way that on the periphery of its runner spoon-shaped buckets or cups are fitted. After passing through nozzles the water strikes these buck- ets, which in turn results in rotating the shaft to produce mechanical energy. This energy is then converted to electric power. Francis Turbine: This is an example of an inward radial-flow reaction turbine and is of relatively medium (specific) speed (between 38 and 380rpm), suitable for medium heads (between 9 and 185m) [8]. In Francis Turbine high pressure water enters the turbine with radial inflow and leaves the turbine axially through the draft tube (Figure A.12). The high-pressure water while passing through guide vanes, located at the periphery of the turbine shaft, rotate the shaft for producing power. The speed of the shaft is maintained constant at various loads by changing the vane angle.

A.9 ENERGY FROM BIOMASS Biomass is a source of renewable energy and is abundantly available. It is an organic matter, which has been used as long as humans have been burning wood to make fire. Biomass is produced from solar energy by photosynthesis. As such, it absorbs the same amount of carbon when growing as it releases when consumed as a fuel. Therefore, it does not add to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and eventually mitigates further increase of greenhouse gas emission. In contrast, combustion of fossil fuels only enhances greenhouse gas emission without any recovery. Biomass is derived from numerous sources, including plant material, byproducts from timber industry, bagasse, agricultural crops, and urban garbage (Figure A.14). Animal and human waste and decomposed garbage waste may be used to produce methane for combustion. Biomass can regrowover a relatively short period of time. It is an important source of energy and the most important fuel worldwide after coal, oil, and natural gas. It can be used directly through combustion in a furnace to boil water, and steam thus produced is used in a conventional turbo-generator to produce electricity. Methane produced from biomass can be used directly in combustion turbines to generate elec- tricity. Biomass can also be used indirectly by converting it to ethanol, which is a AppendixA:PowerfromRenewableEnergy 551 FigureA.14 Someexampleofbiomass. biofuel, and using it for special cars and motor vehicles, which may eventually reduce our dependence on gasoline for driving cars. Some of the biomass used to generate bio-power comprises the following: i. Agricultural wastes, i.e., wheat straw, rice husk, jute stick, etc. ii. Energy crops, i.e., bagasse, bamboo, special type of grass, e.g. switchgrass, etc. iii. Wood and forest residues, i.e., dry leaves, twigs, etc. iv. Wood wastes, i.e., sawdust, wood shavings v.

APPENDIX B Power from Nuclear Energy B.1 INTRODUCTION Compared with the energy-liberating potential of fossil fuels, energy liberated from nuclear fuel is astronomically high. While only 1kg of U235 is capable of liberating about 853106MJ of heat by going through nuclear fission, a quantity of about 53106kg of coal with a high heating value of 17MJ/kg has to be burnt to get an equivalent amount of energy. There are two different methods of energy generation by a nuclear fuel, i.e., either by nuclear fission or by nuclear fusion. When heavy fissile elements are subjected to nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor, chain reactions of these elements take place, releas- ing a huge quantum of energy. In nuclear fusion, simple atomic nuclei are fused together to form complex nuclei (as in case of fusion of hydrogen isotopes to form helium) and in the process liberates a large quantum of energy. The process of nuclear fusion, also known as thermonuclear reaction, is very difficult to control even today. Therefore, at present, the main source of nuclear energy is only available from nuclear fission. The most common fissile radioactive heavy metals are naturally occurring isotope of uranium, U235, artificial isotope of uranium, U233, and artificial element pluto- nium, P239. In a nuclear reactor a controlled chain reaction of nuclear fission of these heavy elements takes place. The nuclear energy thus liberated is converted into heat that is removed from the reactor by a coolant, e.g., liquid sodium, pressur- ized water, etc. Hot coolant is then passed through another heat exchanger, an unfired steam generator, where water is circulated as a coolant, which absorbs heat and results in generation of steam. Steam thus generated is used in a conventional turbo-generator to produce electricity. On one hand, this steam generator is eco- friendly, since it does not emit any carbon dioxide, sulfur, or mercury. But on the other hand, a major concern of a nuclear power plant is that the area surrounding the nuclear reactor is potentially radioactive. Further, nuclear wastes, if not disposed of carefully, could have a devastating effect on living beings and inanimate objects including the environment. There are various types of nuclear reactors used to generate electricity. Some of these reactors, commonly used globally, are discussed in the following. 553 554 AppendixB:PowerfromNuclearEnergy B.2"

Some of these reactors, commonly used globally, are discussed in the following. 553 554 AppendixB:PowerfromNuclearEnergy B.2 PRESSURIZED-WATER REACTOR (PWR) A PWR power plant is composed of two loops in series, i.e., the coolant loop, called the primary loop, and the water-steam or working fluid loop, also known as the secondary loop [1]. The pressurized water in the primary loop passes over the reactor core to act as moderator and coolant. The coolant does not flow to the turbine; it picks up reactor heatandtransfersittotheworkingfluidinthesecondaryloop,whichisanunfiredsteam generator that produces steam. The steam is then used in a Rankine cycle to drive a turbine and generate electricity (Figure B.1 [2] and Figure B.2 [3]). Coolant pressure andtemperatureareusuallymaintainedatabout15.5MPaand618K[3],whichislower than the saturation temperature, and thus boiling of the coolant inside the reactor isavoided.

AppendixB:PowerfromNuclearEnergy 555 Containment structure Steam Pressurizer generator Generator Turbine Control rods Reactor vessel Condenser FigureB.2 Flowdiagramofapressurizedwaterreactor[3]. In a PWR enriched uranium is used as fuel. The reactor’s core generally contains 150(cid:1)200 fuel assemblies [2]. During the design stage all precautions are taken to ensure thatboilingofpressurizedwaterdoesnottakeplacewithinthereactor.Themostattractive advantageof aPWRisthatintheeventof afuelleakinthecoreradioactivecontaminants would not pass to the turbine and condenser. Another advantage is that the pressure and temperature (about 10.5MPa and 588K, respectively) of the steam coming from the PWR is higher than the pressure and temperature available from a boiling water reactor. DisadvantageofPWRisthereactorismorecomplicatedandmorecostlytoconstruct[4]. B.3 BOILING-WATER REACTOR (BWR) In a BWR the same water loop serves as moderator, coolant for the core, and steam source for the turbine. In a BWR, the coolant is in direct contact with the heat- producing nuclear fuel and boils in the same compartment in which the fuel is located (Figure B.3) [5]. Liquid enters the reactor core at the bottom, where it receives sensible heattosaturationplussomelatentheatofvaporization.Whenitreachesatthetopofthe core,itisconvertedintoaverywetmixtureofliquidandvapor.Thevapor isthensepa- rated from the liquid in a steam separator, not shown in Figure B.3, and flowsthrough a turbinetogeneratepower.Thecondensateispumpedbacktothebottomofthereactor.

B.4 GAS-COOLED REACTOR (GCR) A GCR is cooled by a gas (helium or carbon dioxide) [4], unlike the liquid coolant, which is used in a PWR and BWR. During the process of cooling the reactor, the gas absorbs heat; this hot coolant then can be used either directly as the working fluid of a combustion turbine to generate electricity or indirectly to generate steam, which in turn is used in a turbo-generator to produce electricity (Figure B.4) [6,7]. There are two types of GCR. In one type both natural and enriched uranium fuels are used with CO as the coolant and graphite as the moderator. In the other type 2 only enriched fuels are used where the coolant is helium and the moderator is heavy water. The major advantages of adopting this technology are: i. Higher steam temperature, typically about 838K, could be availed with GCR. As a result, higher plant efficiency could be obtained compared to the water cooled design. ii. GCR is less prone to land hazards that could be experienced with water cooled/ moderated reactors. B.5 HEAVY-WATER REACTOR (HWR) In a HWR, or more precisely a pressurized heavy-water reactor (PHWR), the fuel used is natural uranium with pressurized heavy water (deuterium oxide: D O) as 2 coolant-moderator(FigureB.5)[8].Sinceheavywater ispressurizeditcanbeheatedto highertemperatureswithoutboiling,asisthecasewithpressurizedwater inaPWR.

But this higher cost is traded-off to a certain extent by using natural 2 uranium, since in the case of PWR additional cost is incurred for producing enriched uranium. One “proprietary” version of HWR is CANDU, which stands for “Canada Deuterium Uranium” (Figure B.6) [9]. The reactor was designed by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and is currently marketed by Mississauga, Ontario-based Candu Energy Inc. The pressure and temperature of the steam at the outlet of CANDU are typically 4MPa and 524K, respectively. B.6 FAST-BREEDER REACTOR (FBR) The fuel used in a FBR is generally P239, but U235 is also used in certain reactors. Fast breeder reactors are so named because of their design to breed fuel by producing more fissionable fuel than they could consume. In a FBR neutrons are not slowed down to thermal energy by a moderator. Coolant and other reactor materials moder- ate the neutrons. Reactors are cooled by liquid sodium, which also acts as the heat- transfer medium. In lieu of sodium, lithium may also be used as the coolant, but sodium being the most abundant is used commonly [4]. 558 AppendixB:PowerfromNuclearEnergy 4 5 11 2 3 12 6 1 13 10 7 9 8 key 1 Fuel bundle 8 Fueling machines 2 Calandria (reactor core) 9 Heavy water moderator 3 Adjuster rods 10 Pressure tube Heavy water pressure 4 11 Steam going to steam turbine reservoir 5 Steam generator 12 Cold water returning from turbine Containment building made of 6 Light water pump 13 reinforced concrete 7 Heavy water pump FigureB.5 Sectionalviewofatypicalheavywaterreactor[8].

AppendixB:PowerfromNuclearEnergy 559 One major disadvantage of a FBR is it requires higher degree of enrichment of the fuel than do the water moderated reactors. The advantages of using sodium com- pared to using pressurized water are: i. At atmospheric pressure sodium can be liquefied at a moderate temperature of 371Kanditboilsat1156K.Therefore,theoperatingtemperaturerangeofsodium islargeatatmosphericpressureanditdoesnotrequirefurther pressurization. ii. Thermal conductivity of sodium is very large (84W.m 21.K 21 at 298K), as compared to that of water (0.016W.m 21.K 21 at 398K). Hence, it is an efficient heat transfer medium. The disadvantages of using sodium are: i. It is opaque, which hinders visual maintenance. ii. Sodium is an extremely reactive chemical; when comes in contact with air or water it starts burning.

Sodium is an extremely reactive chemical; when comes in contact with air or water it starts burning. On contact with water sodium may even cause explosion, thus safety is at stake. iii. During operation, radioactive sodium-24 may be formed by neutron activation. Therefore, there is also a slight radiation hazard.

This new reactor is called a liquid-metal fast-breeder reactor, or LMFBR [4]. In this reactor liquid sodium is used as a coolant in the primary loop of the reactor. Heat contained in the primary coolant is exchanged with the intermediate coolant, which is also a liquid metal, either sodium or a combination of sodium and potassium, NaK, in a primary heat exchanger. Hot intermediate coolant is then introduced into a sec- ondary heat exchanger, i.e., the steam generator, as a source of heat to boil water and generate steam. A sectional viewof a typical LMFBR is shown in Figure B.7 [10]. In a typical design steam conditions at the superheater outlet are about 10MPa and 759K.

The trainer is based on an existing Thermal Power Plant. The purpose of the trainer is to make the students capable of operating a complete Thermal Power Plant, and to enter malfunctions to see the consequences for the plant. The trainer do also include the subsystems for cleaning of flue gas called Denox and Desox plant. The trainer are run and operated locally on each student station. The instructor has his own computer, where the models can be manipulated and operated. This system allows the instructor to generate new scenarioes and malfunctions, which will make it possible to start simulation from different operational states. The function of all subsystems and units used in the models, are described in chapter 4. Operation of the subsystems are described in chapter 5. The Power Plant Trainer is connected to other systems: Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 1 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 2.1 Simulator Objectives The main purpose of the Thermal Power Plant simulator is to train and assess operators in the operation of Distributed Control Systems (DCS) and in plant operation, including training in plant start-up and shut-down, emergency situations and safety procedures. The simulator will be used as a powerful tool for engineers and plant management to verify process design and control strategies prior to start-up of a plant and to investigate and test operational problems which they are normally not allowed to do in a real plant. The simulator delivered by KONGSBERG MARITIME has the ability to be used in a number of different ways in order to suit the changing needs. Some of these uses are, in chronological order: * Test and tune control loops before implementing on a real system. * Test and modify logic in a dynamic environment. * Familiarise commissioning engineers with the plant and process dynamics. * Allow commissioning engineers to test out different start-up procedures. * Modify control and logic before installing on the real system. * Check out new controls and operating strategies. * Verify process design and study effects of modifications to the process by altering the model. * Optimise the control system and process to maximise economic performance. * Re-train experienced process operators to identify abnormal process conditions and methods of dealing with them. * Re-train"

The instructor controls the boundary conditions by means of the Variable lists. Like all other data in the simulator, the boundary conditions will be defined in the Initial Conditions and can be used in scenarios and events during set-up and run of the simulator exercises. 2.4 Variable lists All model variables are listed in pop-up lists provided. The variable lists are activated by the dedicated push button on the keyboard. The lists include tag-name, descriptive text and alarm status, where applicable, in addition to the actual value at the present state of the simulation. The value of an independent variable can be changed in the variable list. However, the dependent variables are those which are continuously updated by the simulator, and attempts to change those will fail. 2.5 Malfunctions Many of the components included in the simulator are capable of being in a faulty condition or having malfunctions. The instructor can set/reset faults on the malfunction pages, which are pop-up lists similar to the variable lists. The student does also have access to the malfunction lists, but the state of the malfunction is hidden for the student. 2.6 Help system The simulator includes a help system. For each main display it is possible to activate sub displays with relevant help information. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 5 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.7 Mathematical Model The simulated plant produces both electricity to the power grid and hot water to the local utility heating. The boiler is of once-through type. The simulated plant is made available to be fuelled with oil (mainly for start-ups with special start-up burners) or coal. At pure condensation operation the block produces a net electrical output of 255 MW (190 MW for coal). The utility heating hot water effect at back pressure operation is 350 MW with oil, and 260 MW for coal. The process model delivered with the simulator includes: - Choice of combustion of oil or coal. - Boiler with superheaters, economisers, coal powder burners and oil burners. - Air, flue gas, and fuel systems with coal mills, boilers, air preheaters, air filters, primary and secondary combustion air supplies. - Turbine with"

(Quick shutdown valves). An alarm message will be given to the student with a pre-defined time margin, and a proposal of action (see VHS B2.4). - Combustion of oil or coal. (Not both at the same time, except for the short time period when the start-up oil burners are being replaced by the coal burners). Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 7 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.8 Requirements of model accuracy The model will take into account deposit on heat transfer surfaces such as boiler tubes and heat exchangers. The pump flow will vary according to pump and system characteristics. Heat transfer coefficients will vary with fluid flow rates and temperatures. The effect of air accumulation in heat exchangers will be considered in the model. It will be possible to simulate vibrations in the rotor of the turbine. Absolute accuracy cannot be guarantied, since it is impossible to design training simulators for this degree of fidelity and still retain a real-time environment within realistic costs and project schedule. However, as a quantitative test on accuracy, we try to match a particular steady state in the simulator (the design case) to a heat and mass balance provided in VHS SB2.5A-C. For high fidelity models, we would expect the following accuracy figures: Pressure +/- 1.5% of range Flow +/- 2 % of range Temperature +/- 2 % of range Instrumentation +/- 1.5% of instrument range When all available measured plant data becomes available, the model can be tuned to match it to similar degrees of accuracy and steady state. Process plant operation tolerance will be within +/-5% across the normal operating range. We have considerable experience in modelling process equipment, both for training simulators and high fidelity studies and aim to match as closely as possible the simulator response to the behaviour we could expect in the plant. 8 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9 Process Model Sub Systems Many of the steam and water pipes are drawn as a single pipe but consist in reality of double.

(E.g. the intermediate pressure superheater pipe) and sometimes even triple pipes (E.g. condensate and feed water pipes). In the same way the direct heat exchanger (DV 41) consists of two parallel systems. The coal and oil burners consist of 4 burner levels (A - D, with the uppermost level named A). Every burner level consists of 4 burners of each kind. All the components which have multiple notations (a hyphen is used) is understood as a symbolic interpretation of a multiple of equivalent parallel systems. Some of the parallel equivalent components will be simplified by reducing them to one single unit as long as the dynamics and physical properties of the plant are sufficient. As an example the feed water pipes will be modelled as one single pipe. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 9 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.1 Fuel Oil System (MD100) 2.9.1.1 Fuel Oil System Description The FO service tank is heated by steam, supplied from the low pressure steam generator (MD120). The tank is filled by means of a FO transfer pump which operates automatically with a level control system. The suction is taken from one of the bunker tanks (always assumed full). Possible water settled out in the tank should be drained off. The fuel oil to the main burner deck A-D is supplied by a pair of FO supply pumps. Pressure after pumps is controlled by recirculation of oil back to the service tank. The pressure control valve is under PID control. The FO is heated to normal operating temperature by either of two steam heaters, before it flows to burner deck A-D. There is recirculation of fuel from the burner decks to the service tank during preheating or trip. 10 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The temperature of the fuel oil, which is measured in the common line after the FO heaters, is controlled by a temperature controller (PID) which controls the steam flow through the heaters. The system has double delivery filters. Main Fuel controller The aim of the main fuel controller is to control the fuel flow to the boiler depending on the actual load independent of the kind of fuel or combination of fuels which is used. The main fuel controller (01-HB) gets its set point value from the block load controller (10- BLM) which is compared to the total measured amount of supplied fuel. The total amount of"

The main fuel controller (01-HB) gets its set point value from the block load controller (10- BLM) which is compared to the total measured amount of supplied fuel. The total amount of supplied fuel is the sum of the oil flow from the oil measurement equipment and the equivalent amount of coal measured from the speed of rotation of the coal feeders. The output from the fuel controller (01-HB) is distributed to the different burner levels via multiplication units (01-HB A-D). These proportioned signals are input to the coal feeder controllers (01-KM A) and the oil flow controllers by means of the gain (10-BO A), where the coal flow is subtracted before the signal continues to (08-BO A) where the signal is compared with the total measured amount of oil supplied to the burner level. Oil temperature control The oil temperature is controlled by a PI-controller. It affects the steam supply valve (OT) on the oil preheater.

If the Intermediate turbine bleeder pressure is too low, steam is provided from the auxiliary steam system. In cases of emergency, the steam source is from the auxil. steam system. The flow of steam to the heat exchanger in the steam generator's steam drum is automatically controlled to keep the secondary steam pressure constant. 12 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The condensate from the heating coil is drained to a separate primary drain tank before it is discharged to the make-up deaerator. The rate of primary condensate discharge is controlled so that the drain cooler always is filled with water. Secondary drain from miscellaneous heaters is collected in the inspection tank. This is designed for easy observation and removal of possible oil contamination. For production of cleaning steam and atomising steam a special steam cooling tank is provided.

A summation of the oil flow to the burner levels is done in the P-controller (09-BO A). This signal is then used for controlling the secondary air flow.

Supply of fuel to the burner deck is from the FO system (MD100). The burner deck has four burners. They are operated by push button commands on the burner control panel. Burner 1 to 4 are normally lighted off on fuel from cold plant start-up. The option of firing with coal can only be performed when burners are already fired on FO. The burners shall always be lit off in the following sequence 1,3 and 2,4. The light off sequence will be indicated. Ignition is confirmed by the flame scanner signals. It is possible to change to coal firing, this requires that system for coal transportation system is running. Hot and cold air are mixed by a temp. controller, and a primary air fan supplies air to the coal grinder. 14 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The coal silo supplies coal to the coal feeder system.

A boiler safety system closes the boiler trip valve and the fuel oil shut off valves to both burners at the following condition: - flame out on both burners - no forced draft fan running - atomising steam pressure low - water drum level low - water drum level high At trip the recirculation valve is opened. This is automatically closed when fire is detected on any burner. Secondary air flow control during oil combustion Each one of the four oil burners on each burner level has its own secondary air flow controller (which is simplified in the model to one controller for each level) with the notation SLA1. Each one of these gets a set point value in the form of a fuel set point value. At start-ups of the plant there is a specified ignition set point value of the secondary air flow. As soon as the start-up commence, the secondary air throttle is opened until the measured value corresponds to the ignition set point value. The positions of the 16 secondary air flow throttles (4 in the model) are compared, whereas the position of the most open throttle is an input to control the air and flue gas fans. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 15 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Coal feeder controllers (KM A-D) The aim of the coal feeder control is to make sure that the coal feeder feeds coal to the mill according to the required fuel effect on each burner level. There are four coal feeders (on each level) which are responsible for supplying each burner level with coal. There is no simple way to measure coal flow, but there is a certain speed of rotation/volume relation on the feeder, which makes it possible to use the rotational speed of the feeder as a measure of the coal flow to the mill. The fuel set value is distributed to the oil flow controllers (10-BOA) and the coal feeder control (01-KMA). The coal feeder controller gives a control signal to the coal feeder which controls the speed of rotation in proportion to the control signal. Primary air flow controller The primary air has two main functions, that is to dry the coal in the mill, and to transport it between the mill and the burner. One part of the control problem is to keep the air flow velocity above a certain limit (18 m/s) in the coal powder pipes. Another aim is to get a"

One part of the control problem is to keep the air flow velocity above a certain limit (18 m/s) in the coal powder pipes. Another aim is to get a coal powder/air ratio, which gives satisfactory combustion. The primary air is extracted from the combustion air system, partially in the form of hot air in the circular air channel and partially in the form of cold air from the pressure side of the main air fans. The primary air controllers shall have minimal set value of 18 m/s (corresponds to the primary air flow at minimal speed of rotation on the coal feeders). Another signal is proportional to the speed of rotation of the coal feeder, that means proportional to the mill load, and corresponds to 30 m/s in the coal powder pipes at full load. Four parallel primary air controllers is thus required. The actual value to the controllers is the volume flow at the entrance to the coal mill. Mill temperature controllers (KT A-D) The coal which enters the coal mill has got a surface moisture, which has to evaporate by the heat in the primary air flow. The surface moisture is normally between 8 and 12%. To get a temperature of 85dgrC after the mill, an inlet temperature of between 190 and 280dgrC is required, depending on the load and the moisture of the coal. The mill temperature controller (01-KTA) gets its value from the temperature measurement point at the outlet of the mill. The set point value is normally 85dgrC but for start-ups there is a heating period whereas an integrator increases the set point value from the surrounding temperature with a temperature gradient of 5dgeC/min. When the outlet temperature from the mill exceeds the set point value, the cold air throttle is opened. If the temperature continues to increase when the cold air throttle is fully open, the hot air throttle will close slightly to supply colder air. 16 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 <This page is intentionally left blank> Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 17 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.4 Block Master Control System (MD190) 18 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.4.1 Block Master Control System Description The Block Master control system consits of two major parts: One part controlling the rate of fuel input to the boiler system and one part controlling where to discharge the blocks’ waste heat.

Part one is based on one steam controller (BLM) which has its set point generated either from an electric power controller (BLE) or from a district heat water temperature controller (BLW). The output signal from the steam flow controller is an energy signal for the fuel master control system. It is checked and possibly reduced in a logic system called “block load reduction system” (BLR). Part two consists of a single temperature controller (TMC). The inlet dampers of the LP turbines and the steam flow to direct heaters are controlled from measured district heat water temperature. The Block Load Master Controller (BLM) corresponds with the master steam pressure controller of fixed pressure boilers. It controls the steam flow according to set point. The Block load reduction system (BLR) limits the fuel command from the master controller if necessary. The limiting value is displayed (G01952). If this limit is exceeded, the BLM controller is switched to Manual, the fuel signal is reduced to limit, BLR alarm will be given (AG05.X01963) and the cause of the limitation indicated by a “reduction index”. (To get reduction index text, click on index display.) An overview of load reduction causes and corresponding limits is given on MVP1901. Note that the reduction associated with the turbine trip or main circuit breaker trip, will be overidden if the turbine is not in operation. The inhibition signal for this is taken from the HP turbine supply valve, V03001. When this valve close, BLR reduction 4 & 5 are cancelled. An BLR action should be followed by manual firing at rates below BLR limit, until the cause of reduction is corrected. The BLR function is always present, regardless of Manual or Auto mode. In Auto mode, the limit not to be exceeded, G011952 is automatically set according to plant state. In manual mode, the limit must be manually set by the operator at his choice. In addition to the limiting function, the BLR controller performs rate limitations of the fuel command (up and down). If the source of a block reduction is corrected, the BLR system will slowly increase the fuel command towards the RLM controller command.

Air is: - entering the forced draft fans - preheated in the air preheater - mixed with oil and burned in the furnace space to flue gas Flue gas is: - radiating heat to the furnace walls and superheater - cooled by convection heat transfer in the steam generating tube bank and the superheater - cooled further in the feed water economiser - cooled to final flue gas temperature in the air preheater before entering the funnel Forced Draft Fans The forced draft fans must be started or stopped manually. The air flow is controlled by air dampers on the suction side of each fan. The damper is normally controlled by a signal from the combustion control system but direct, manual position control is provided for when the damper control selector is set to LOCAL. The forced draft fans are modelled with flow characteristics dependent on suction air damper position in a manner which is typical of large, centrifugal fans. The electric power consumption is computed. The drive motor can be overloaded. The forced draft fans represent very heavy consumers on the electric power system. The discharge shut off damper is automatically opened/closed according to whether motor is running or not. Regenerative Air preheater There are two Air-preheaters of the regenerative, rotating (Ljungstrom) type. The slowly revolving rotor is driven by an electric motor. The reduction gear and rotor bearings are lubricated by an auxiliary system which is not modelled in detail. The dynamic heat transfer response, depending on number of revolutions, rotor masses, air and exhaust temperatures and heat transfer coefficients is, however, modelled correctly. The effect of the typical air leakage from air to exhaust side, found in rotating air preheaters, is included in the model. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 21 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The air side can be bypassed by a manually operated damper. This is to be used at prolonged operation with low boiler load, which can lead to very low exhaust gas temperatures and associated excessive acid formation.

Combustion control The aim of the combustion control is to adapt and control the combustion parameters according to the load and number of burners and mills in operation. In addition, the combustion control has to be in operation during start-ups and shutdowns of the boiler. In the simulator the user should experience a physically reliable start-up. The fuel control and the automatic sequencing of burners and fans are simplified to such a degree that the requirements mentioned above are fulfilled and so that the principles for how a start-up is performed are highlighted to the student (without the need of detailed modelling of each burner controller, coal mill, air- and flue gas-throttle). As an example, one burner level (four oil and four coal burners) can principally be modelled as two burners (one for oil and one for coal). The start-up of the block is governed by an automatic sequence. The control unit consists of a cascade controller with a main controller and a set value controller to the previous one, which gives the load dependent pressure increase in the circular air channel. The main controller gets a fixed set point value, which is equivalent to the pressure in the circular channel which is required to ignite the fuel and to supply enough cooling air at low loads. To this a pressure set value is added which is required so that one of the secondary air flow throttles does not exceed a pre definable degree of opening. The measured value in the main controller is the pressure in the circular air channel. The output signal from the main controller is connected to two multiplication units (17-VL and 18-VL) and becomes proportioned set values to respective air fan controllers (02-VL1 and 02-VL2). 22 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Furnace pressure controller (EP) The combustion in the boiler takes place at a balanced pressure (which means constant pressure in the furnace independent of the load), which requires a co-operation between air and flue gas fans and the combustion control. Pressure drop in mills, coal powder pipes and burners are taken into account. The main furnace pressure controller (01-EP) gets its set value from the control panel.

The signal passes to the turnable guide vanes of the flue gas fans. Manual control of the fans is possible to be able to operate at both over pressure and sub-pressure operation. Main air flow control (HL) and O2 correction In the control equipment there is no main air control in any normal sense, since the main air flow is not directly determined from the fuel flow. Instead, the minimal air flow is determined, and the required air excess (in relation to the minimal air flow) with a O2 correction by means of the main air controller (05-HL). The main air controller gets three input signals, of which the signal 06-HL is the main factor for the counter 01-SLA at zero load. The two other input signals give complementary information about desired set value to 01-SLA to give the desired O2 concentration in the flue gas which is desired at any specific load. The output signal from 01-SLA affects respective secondary air flow controller. There is also a summation unit (03-HL) which adds the primary and secondary air flows. The output signal of this addition unit is an input to the controller for combustion pressure (EP). Secondary air control with coal combustion The secondary air flow has to be adapted to combustion independent of the type of coal used. Coal is supplied from one mill to respective burner level. The secondary air flow to the burner level is proportional to the mill load. The main air controller and the O2 correction, makes sure that the combustion is performed according to desired combustion parameters.

Its valve position can be set directly in LOCAL control. REMOTE control is from the boiler panel. The feed water is heated in a preheater before it is supplied to the economiser. After the economiser the feed water enters into the evaporator. Steam is produced in the evaporator. The steam is then going to superheater 1. The superheated steam is then supplied to a steam/water separator which has a certain water level to isolate full steam pressure from the feed water deaerator tank. The heated water in the cyclone separator is supplied to the feed water preheater on primary side. The steam is then led from the separator into superheater 2, from this into the desuperheater where the outlet steam temperature is regulated. The automatically controlled steam temperature valve adjusts the flow to the steam desuperheater so the steam temperature at the second superheater section outlet is correct. The control is done in two steps: control of steam temperature inlet SH2, \"temperature after mixing\", and control of steam temperature outlet SH3, \"final steam temperature\" . The superheater and the steam supply lines are protected by a safety valve after the superheater. Valves for bottom blow off or top (surface skimming) blow off are included. The blow of goes to a bottom blow tank. For filling of boiler water a special line is provided called filling line. Control of water level in water separation tank In some situations, for example at start-ups or at too large feed water flow, the water level in the separation unit is controlled by the AN-, ANB- and ZR-valves. Hereby the AN-, ANB-valves are responsible for keeping sufficient circulation in the fire tube walls during start-ups and low load operation. The ZR-valve is supposed to control the water level at higher levels, when the other two valves are not sufficient.

The water level ranges of each valve are divided from lowest to highest level in the following order: ANB, AN, ZR. Each valve is opened proportionally to the desired level in the corresponding range. The ZR gets an executive closing signal when the pressure in the water separator tank exceeds a certain value (20 kp/cm2). Pre superheater temperature controller (U2E) The steam temperature at the superheater outlet is controlled to a certain set value by injecting water before the superheater (injection valve U2E). The only task of the controller Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 27 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 is to prevent the superheater from occasional overheating, whereby the set value is set from the control panel. A PI-controller compares the temperature at the outlet of the superheater with a set point value and corrects the injection valve in proportion to the deviation. The outlet temperature follows a change in the injection flow quite slowly, whereby the value of the temperature after the injection valve is proportionally input to the controller. Post superheater temperature controller (U3E) The aim of this controller is to control the steam temperature at the outlet of the two superheaters by adjusting the injection flow according to set point value. The set point value is supposed to decrease with decreasing load below a certain load level. In the same way, it is possible to increase the set point value at start-ups with a pre-defined gradient from a given temperature to a pre-defined output temperature. The set point value of the post superheater temperature is adjusted from the control panel. However, at a pre-defined load, this set point value is decreased with decreasing load and increased with increasing loads. This is taken care of by an executive set point value controller (which has a pre-defined gradient). The manner of action of the post superheater temperature controllers is the same as for the pre superheaters (A2.3.5). Only the set point value is common for the two control units by the previously described set value controller. It is also possible to vary the heat absorption proportions between the two superheaters by adding a suitable constant to the measured superheated steam temperature before it is compared with the set value.

The boiler outlet pressure controller controls the pressure after the boiler water separation unit, according to a set value which is defined on the control panel. 28 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 <This page is intentionally left blank> Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 29 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.8 Boiler Steam System (MD250) 30 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.8.1 Boiler Steam System Description High Pressure steam line The piping from the boiler superheater 3 outlet is a separate steam line: - HP steam line to HP turbine. The main steam line supplies the HP turbine. The HP turbine has a bypass control system if HP steam shall be fed to the district heater system. Intermediate Pressure steam line The piping from HP turbine outlet is the supply for reheater 1. - IP steam return from HP turbine. The temperature for the reheated IP steam supply is controlled by a separate temperature controller which mixes the steam with feed water. The outlet from reheater 2 is the IP steam supply to IP turbine. - IP steam line to IP turbine There are bypass and drain valves for heating and drainage of steam lines before use. Intermediate superheater temperature controller (ZUE) The steam temperature in the hot intermediate pressure superheated steam pipe is controlled (kept at a constant level) by injection of feed water through the ZUE-valves. The intermediate superheater steam temperature is not constant over the whole load range but is reduced at decreasing load. This is why the PI-controller holds a set point value which is valid at 100 % load and a correction value at decreasing load. The actual set point value to the controller is equal to the mean temperatures at the outlets of the two hot ZUE-pipes. A set point value which is adjustable from the control panel affects the two ZUE-injection controllers (of type PI). The measured value is also in this case identical to the mean value of the temperatures at the outlets of the two ZUE-pipes which each is connected to the injection valves (ZUE). Thermal Power"

The IP steam line from reheater 2 supplies the IP turbine. There are a bypass control system for the inlet to HP turbine.

(MD430) High pressure feed heaters. (MD440) Boiler water system. (MD240) Bypass controller (BP, BPE) The bypass control before the HP turbine consists of a three way control valve (BP) which is opened and in this way determines the amount of steam which enters the HP-turbine. One of the inlets in this valve injects feed water from another control valve (BPE). This control system has different aims depending on the operational mode (normal operation, operation without turbine, start-ups or shutdowns). Normal operation: At normal operation the BP-control system is ready to keep the boiler pressure (set point value) within certain limits when there are disturbances such as changes in the steam flow (to turbine) or changes in the steam production. The set point value is also supposed to follow the glide pressure curve. When the pressure rises, the BP-valves open simultaneously so that the pressure is kept at the set point value. If the disturbance is causing a pressure drop the BP-valves closes somewhat to keep the pressure constant. Another important function is to keep the pressure time derivative below a certain limit. The BP-valves are should also protect the boiler from exceeding the maximal boiler pressure (in order not to get frequent use of the security valves). Operation without turbine: When the heat production under certain conditions has to be maintained even without the use of a turbine, the BP-controller maintain the boiler pressure. The boiler pressure then has to be controlled at a constant value. It is possible to adjust the desired pressure on the control panel. Start-ups and shut downs: At start-ups and shutdowns of the block, the BP-control system (in"

The cooling water is taken from the lake, and returned to lake after the cold condenser. The vacuum of the main condenser is maintained by two mechanical vacuum pumps. Normally one is in operation at a time. The vacuum pumps has a special system for sealing water which comprises two pumps. Steam inlet to the condenser is from the LP turbine (MD300). The condensate is collected in the hotwell below the condenser shell. Three electrically driven condensate pumps are pumping the condensate from the hotwell to the LP feed heater (MD420), through a gland condenser. Condensate pump 1 & 2 has the same rate and size, but condensate pump 3 is a smaller pump. The water level in the condenser is controlled, to protect the main turbine from damage if level is too high, or to prevent the condensate pumps from cavitating, if level is too low. The level is controlled by recirculation of condensate back to the condenser. Water level control in cold condenser Water level control in the cold condenser KK4 is realised by controlling valves (RV 427-8) with a PID-controller at the outlet of the condenser.

The main condenser has a separate level control system. If the level is low, the level controller open supply from the make up deaerator tank. The main condensate tank has a separate vacuum pump with a sealing water system. There are three main condensate pumps in the system with safety valves, delivery and suction valves. The condensate pumps have a sealing water system. There are implemented a dump valve on the discharge from the main condensate pumps, to make dumping of condensate water possible. The delivery is to the lake. For the complete thermal power plant there is a common cleaning plant. This is not modelled, just indicated on the picture.

Supply line is from main condensate tank. It is a possibility to run the condensate through a filter plant with 2 POWDEX filters. The system is used as long as the condensate has low temperature (During start up). After the temperature reaches normal level the filter efficiency is getting too low. There is ventilation lines between each LP feed heater which have to be opened before starting the system. Each LP feed heater have a separate level control system. If the level is getting too high the condensate is drained back to the cold condenser. For heating of the LP feed heaters Turbine extraction's on IP turbine is used (MD300). The feedwater outlet from LP feed heater 3 is going to the feedwater deaerator tank. The LP3 feed heater has a safety valve installed.

There are three main feed water pumps implemented in the system with a recirculation system back to the feedwater deaerator tank. The recirc. system is pressure controlled through a pressure shock absorber. The feed water pump motors are water-cooled and the pump has a sealing water system. The delivery goes through a common feedwater line to a valve and the into the high pressure feed heaters. The delivery is also divided to the boiler water make up line. The feedwater deaerator tank has a special clean up line valve for cleaning of condensate before start up. For temperature control of the feedwater deaerator tank, a line from IPC is implemented with a separate temperature controller. 40 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 For level control of the feedwater deaerator tank there is a supply line from the LP feed heaters controlled from a level controller.

Feed water deaerator tank pressure controller (SBD) There are two main goals of the feed water pressure control system: - To keep the rate of change of pressure in the feed water tank between certain limits. - To keep a minimal pressure in the feed water tank to prevent cavitation in the feed water pumps. When any of the two limits above is exceeded, the pressure is changed by the SBD-valve. This valve is normally closed. It is affected by a PI-controller. If the pressure in the feed water tank falls quicker than the pre-set limit of the rate of change, the valve is opened, while at constant pressure or at a small pressure gradient the valve is kept closed. A second control signal, superior to the first one, opens the valve if the measured pressure is below the minimal feed water pressure (which is set by the control panel). A normal value of the minimal pressure is 2.5 bar. Feed water level controller (SBN) The water level in the feed water tank is affected by changes in the feed water flow (control valve SBN). Feed water controllers (SW, DR). The aim with the feed water control is to, at any load condition, supply the boiler with the correct amount of feed water. At low load, the feed water control guarantees that the boiler gets the required amount of water, so that no overheated zones exist in the boiler. The control equipment comprises a main controller for set point value determination, a flow controller, valve controller, speed control of feed water pumps, and temperature correction control. The text below describes in short how these controllers are connected and how they work. - Main controller for set value determination: The main signal to control the feed water flow is obtained from the fuel flow signal. This signal is input to the P-controller (20-SW) to which also the correction signal from the temperature correction controller is connected. The output from the controller is a measure of the desired water flow to the boiler based on fuel flow and temperature correction. This output is input to the flow controller. - Flow controller: The output from the set point value controller (20-SW) is the main set point value to the flow controller (10-SW). The controlled variable is the feed water flow, as measured before the economiser.

Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 41 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 As a positive input to the controller there is also a fixed set point value. This value represents the minimal feed water flow (approximately 260 ton/h). The flow controller is of PI type and has double outputs, of which one is input to the valve control and the other is input to the speed control of the feed water pumps. - Valve control: The valve controller affects the actuator on the feed water control valve. The controller is the proportional type and receives a feedback signal from the position of the valve. The aim with the feed water controller is to obtain sufficient pressure drop for the injection control and to obtain quick correction of the feed water flow which is required to counteract disturbances. The speed control of the feed water pumps is slow and is not quick enough to counteract disturbances. - Speed control of feed water pumps: The speed control unit consists of a main speed controller (20-DR) of PI-type. The output from the flow controller (10-SW) is input to 20-DR where it is compared to a set value from 28-DR. At deviations the output of 20-DR is affected. With the set value from 28-DR, the position of the feed water valve can be set in advance. The output from 20-DR is connected to each of three multiplication units before entering as control signal to the speed controllers (DR 1-3) of the feed water pumps. - Temperature correction control: The aim of the temperature correction is to keep the boiling temperature in the boiler at a suitable value, so that the fluid at the exit of the evaporator keeps at a constant temperature and is slightly superheated. The control unit consists of the controller (22-SW) and the D-controller (23-SW) which are connected in cascade. The D-controller has a load-dependent time constant, which is controlled by the block load controller (23-BLM). This is necessary because the time from the exit of the evaporator to the final temperature measuring point differs considerably between low and full load. The temperature is measured at the exit of the evaporator and is input to 23-SW. In this way there is a tendency justification of the feed water flow. The steam flow after the water separation tank is measured and is also an input to 23- SW with the same effect as previously described. 42 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 <This page is intentionally left blank> Thermal Power Plant TPP"

The full heat production of 4 hours can be stored for later release. Operation of the heat storage tank will depend on electric power price, weather condition and time of day. The accumulator tank enables a more safe and optimal power plant operation. Normal procedure will be to charge the accumulator at day time and thus producing much electric power at high price, and discharge the accumulator during night when electric power price is lower. Hot water demand varies from hour to hour. For instance high hot water requirement in the morning (showers), high power requirement in the afternoon (cooking) etc. The accumulator makes is easier to meet such changing heat loads and electric power demands. Accumulator tank The accumulator tank is operating at atmospheric pressure.

    "text": "heat loads and electric power demands. Accumulator tank The accumulator tank is operating at atmospheric pressure. It is based on the principle that hot water is lighter than cold water. t is therefor possible to store the water in stable temperature layers with hardly any inter mixing, assuming water is supplied to the tank top, or removed from the tank bottom without turbulence. The specific water density of 55 dgr C water is 986 kg/cubm, while it is 962 kg/cubm at 95 dgr C. This represents a weight difference of 25 kg/cubm. The useful load volume of the tank is 22000 cubm and the total heat storage capacity amounts to 1150 MW with a temperature difference of 45 dgrC. The maximum load or unload rate is 5000 cubm/h, which corresponds to approximately 250 MW. This means that the power plant has a good momentary heat reserve in case of disturbances like turbine or boiler trip. As the working pressure of the DHW pipe line is 80-100 mWL, 60-80 mWL pressure head is available for the water turbine installed to help driving the accumulator pump, pumping water back to the DHW pipe line from the accumulator tank. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 53 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Turbine power varies with flow and pressure. It can be as high as 750 kW. Never the less the turbine power is not in any mode of operation sufficient for driving the accumulator pump up to balanced water flow. The speed of the combined turbine/pump unit is boosted by an electric motor with speed control facility, to control the flows to and from the accumulator tank to desired (usually equal) values. Flow through the turbine is manually controlled by opening or closing the inlet dampers of the turbine. The volume difference between unloaded (cold) and loaded (hot) accumulator tank amounts to approximately 575 cubm. This corresponds to an level variation of 0.5 m in the accumulator tank. The pump speed is controlled to keep the expantion tank level constant, and all variations in water density will be reflected in changing accumulator tank level. Description of accumulator tank interior In the tank bottom there is a fixed distribution system for cold water. In the tank top there is a movable float arrangement with 4 movable floats mounted on 4 arms. The arms are flexibly connected to the hot water supply pipe in the center of tank. The system is designed to discharge water with as low velocity as possible, to avoid turbulence and mixing of hot and cold water layers. The volume above the water level is to be held free of oxygen.

The volume above the water level is to be held free of oxygen. The air in the zone above the water is removed by a hot water spray system. A collecting arrangement for surface water is used for recirculation of spray water, which is kept at the boiling point by a steam heater. The steam to the heater is controlled according to the tank top pressure. Normal pressure is 30 mmWL above atmospheric pressure. To active the spray system, start the spray pump. The system is not modeled in detail. To protect the accumulator tank from excessive over or under pressure, a water seal is mounted a tank top. It opens at 65 mmWL and -40 mmWL. In addition safety valves open at 90 mmWL for extra protection (Not shown on drawing). The water temperature distribution vertically in the tank is monitored by 20 platina resistance sensors mounted on a vertical wire going from tank top to bottom. Turbine and pump unit Between the turbine and the pump is a centrifugal clutch mechanism that releases the turbine from the pump shaft when the turbine shaft speed is below 200 rpm. The turbine is a francis turbine type with spiral shaped inlet casing. Inlet dampers can be manually set for flow adjustment. The turbine shut off valve is closed if the electric motor stops, or if any trip signal is present. 54 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The turbine bearings are lubricated by a separate lubrication system including a LO cooler. This system is not modeled. The accumulator pump is of the same type and capacity as the DHW supply and return pumps. The speed can be controlled by varying the rotor resistance through an electrolytic boiler rheostat, as for all major speed controlled pumps in the power plant system. Accumulator temperature protection A temperature control system protects the accumulator tank from being loaded by too hot water. This is done by recirculation of cold water from the accumulator pump to turbine inlet, when necessary. If loading temperature exceeds 101 dgrC for some time, turbine trip signal will be given. If the turbine is set for accumulator tank loading, and the pump motor is started, an open pulse is given to the recirculation valve, for flushing of cold water through the turbine piping. The open pulse at start lasts for 100 sec. Expansion tank The pressure at the DHW supply pumps, called the “intermediate pressure”, is to be controlled within the range 7.5 to 8.5 bar."

Expansion tank The pressure at the DHW supply pumps, called the “intermediate pressure”, is to be controlled within the range 7.5 to 8.5 bar. The pressure is controlled by water flowing back and forth between the supply pumps inlet and the expansion tank, depending on pressure head difference. The expansion tank has a steam cushion at top controlled by a separate steam system. The steam system is not modeled in detail. The tank bottom pressure will be the sum of the steam pressure at top and the static liquid pressure head. Normal tank level is 18 m. Make up/dump system If the expansion tank level gets too low for some reason, a special dump valve opens and dumps water from the DHW system to the accumulator tank. If the expansion tank level is too low, a make up controller opens the make up valve and water is pumped from the accumulator tank to the DHW system. The make up pumps are automoatically started when the make up valve position is more than 25 % open. The make up/dump system controlles the expansion tank level at times when the accumulator turbine/pump system is not in operation. Should a major leakage in the DHW net work occur, the make up pumps will start and alarm will be given if the make up flow is above a certain limit (150 t/h).

The method is built on a selective catalytic reduction. The medium used for the reduction is ammonia gas. The plant comprises to SCR (selective catalytic reduction) reactors and an ash silo. There are different dampers which is channelling the flue gas either into or bypass the SCR-reactor. Before the DeNox plant can be set into operation a special heating procedure has to be done. A certain fouling of the catalysators is modelled. The effect of this fouling will be an increase of the difference pressure over the SCR. A manually initiated soot blowing will clean the surfaces in the reactor. Flue gas distribution Channels are leading flue gas from the boiler to the reactors.

There are two groups of channels, one on each side of the boiler consisting of three channels in front of and two channels after the economiser respectively. Normally the flue gas is lead through the economiser. In the case of low gas temperature after the economiser, gas is by-passed the economiser via channels and dampers to the outlet in order to keep the temperature at set point. Hence warmer gas from the economiser inlet is mixed with gas from the economiser outlet. On each side of the boiler, outlet channels are joined together. The design of the channels guaranties thorough mixing of gases before gas is lead to the reactors. Each reactor has an inlet and an outlet damper. It is possible to bypass a reactor via a so called by-pass channel. The by-pass channel comprises a damper which is used to control the flow of gas. After the reactors the flue gas is lead to the sulphur absorber and electric filter via the air preheaters. Combustion air is lead via preheaters and spiral pipes to the boiler. Hot flue gas is used in the preheaters to heat the combustion air. When heating of a reactor is required, warm combustion air is drawn from the spiral pipes. A fan provides circulation of air through the reactor. A damper at the reactor inlet, and a damper downstream and upstream of the fan are used to control flow of air. Combustion air drawn from the spiral pipes is also used to seal the by-pass dampers in order to avoid leakage of flue gas.

The two outlets is the \"ordinary\" outlets to the reactor, but if the flue gas temperature is not high enough it is possible to take flue gas from the outlets before the economiser. Ammonia Injection The ammonia injection system comprises a high pressure fan, a gas mixer, and 16 nozzle pipes. Guiding vanes are leading air via a filter and a damper to the air fan. A sensor is used to measure air pressure in the channel after the air fan. The air is lead from the fan via a pipe to a mixing chamber where ammonia is injected, at a ratio of 1 vol. % NH3 per 20 vol. % air.

After mixing the gas is flowing to the nozzle tubes which are inserted into the flue gas channel at the reactor inlet. The tubes furnish a great number of nozzles and the ammonia/air gas mixture is injected and distributed evenly in the flue gas channel. A measuring device (venturi) installed between the fan and mixing chamber is used to measure flow of air. An orifice plate is used to measure consumption of ammonia. The ammonia pipe connected to the mixing chamber comprises a control valve and a shut off valve. A controller is used to control the flow of ammonia gas injected into the mixer. Measurement of NOx in the flue gas is used as input to the controller. A sensor installed in the reactor outlet channel is used to measure content of ammonia in the flue gas, and an alarm is issued in the case of high content. If the content of ammonia exceeds a certain limit, the supply of ammonia is shut off. The pipes leading ammonia to the nozzles are furnished with orifice plates. During fine tuning of the plant flow measurements are used to adjust the flow of ammonia. The reactor itself consists of replaceable catalysator elements, inlet/outlet and soot blowing equipment. The catalysator has a surface which is active and it will react with the flue gas which is injected with ammonia gas.

The reactor is made up of three parts, namely, the inlet, the reactor chamber, and the outlet. The reactor chamber comprises a 13 m tall container with sides 6 x 9 m. Flue gas and ammonia/air mixture enter the inlet at the top of the construction. The inlet furnishes guiding vanes, and the gas is distributed evenly over the inlet area. A total of 54 modules are distributed in the chamber on two planes, each plane containing 27 units. The efficiency of a catalyst unit decreases after approximately 3 years. There are room for more units on a third plane. The catalysts are of the plate type. Every module consists of a stock with embedded plates. The plates are covered with an active material, which constitutes the real catalyst. Leading plates are installed in order to force the gas through the catalysts. The flue gas leaves the reactor in the bottom. Matter is formed in the reaction between ammonia and flue gas, and a greater part of this matter drops down into two pockets when the gas-flow suddenly changes direction. Periodically the pockets are emptied via a damper and leading channel into the ejector. The matter is then transported to a cyclone by means of pressurised air. The cyclone is common to both reactors. A differential pressure sensor is used to monitor that product is not clogging the reactor. If the differential pressure exceeds 62 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 a given limit, an alarm is sounded. The differential pressure is continuously monitored and recorded. The system supplying pressurised air to the ejectors is furnished with a pressure gauge. A pneumatic shut off valve is installed in front of each ejector. A sensor is used to measure pressure after each ejector. Soot Blowers Both reactors are furnished with soot blowers, and pressurised steam is used to clean the catalysts. The soot blowers are operated manually, either from the central control room or from a local panel. This operation is initiated when the differential pressure over the reactor exceeds a given limit. Reactor heating When starting up from cold state or in order to keep the reactor warm, hot combustion air is drawn from the spiral channel. See appendix E.

The filling of the main silo is done by trucks. The filling of the lime day silo is done by a conveyer belt and a scoop lift system. The lime day silo has a filter to remove and separate lime dust. The lime is transported down to a weight system and a conveyer belt to feed a continuos and correct amount of lime to the slake system. From here the lime is led into the slake tanks. Lime and water are mixed in the slake tanks with a propeller mixer. The overflow from the slake tanks are piped to the slake suspension tank where even more water are added to make the suspension pump able. The slake suspension is pumped to a slake feeder tank through a strainer. The slake is pumped up to a slake spreader tank and the overflow of this tank is piped back to the feeder tank. The absorber has two inlets for flue gas, one for 40% (bottom inlet) and one for 60% of the flue gas (on top of the absorber).

The feeder tank is also supplied from mixer tank 1 and 2. The purpose is to mix product from the electric filter with slake suspension. The slake suspension is supplied to a spreader tank which supplies the electrically driven rotating spreader. The overflow of this tank is returned to the feeder tank. The delivery out of the feeder tank is controlled by the level in the feeder tank, and the level is controlled by the filling from the slake suspension tanks. The setpoint is taken from the power used by the spreader. Processing of Feeder Slurry Slake suspension and product slurry is mixed in the feeder tank, and the resulting slurry is fed to the spreader at the absorber. The total amount of slake suspension and product slurry that is fed to the feeder tank is determined by controller LIC816's output signal and consumption of feeder slurry. The flow of slurry to the absorber is proportional to the spreaders power consumption. The proportion of slake suspension to product slurry is determined by SO controller QIC820. 2 The content of SO in the flue gas is measured at the chimney. The measurement is input to 2 the SO controller. The controller adjusts the multiplication factor of the multiplication 2 units connected to slake suspension flow controller FIC818 and product slurry flow controller FIC817 respectively.

The diagram does also give an overview of transducers and control systems. From an economic point of view, it is important to keep the consumption of lime as low as possible. The optimum is reached when the flue gas temperature in the chimney is close to the dew point. How close to the dew point it is possible to operate the plant depends on the spreaders and absorbers function and the control systems response to load variations. The humidity of the de-sulphurization product increases rapidly as the operating point gets close to the dew point. Together with the dew point, the humidity of the de- sulphurization product are important parameters indicating process efficiency and operational economy. The dew point sensor is located in the chimney close to the SO sensor. The sensor is 2 denoted TI739 in the diagram, see appendix 6. Actually there are two sensors. The highest value of the measurements is input to an addition unit where a value corresponding to 10o C is added. This ensures that the set point to the controller is at least 10o C higher than the flue gas dew point. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 79 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 At start up, during heavy changes of load, and during abnormal operations, safety precautions require a flue gas set point with a higher margin to the dew point. During the above mentioned conditions, a safety margin of 20o C is added to the set point by pushing a button on the control panel as indicated in the diagram. The same procedure is also followed in the case of soot blowing of catalysts in the reactor since the steam flow adds"

The same procedure is also followed in the case of soot blowing of catalysts in the reactor since the steam flow adds humidity to the flue gas. The variation of steam flow depends on the intermittent operation. Controllers TIC821 and EIC822 are connected in cascade, that is the output signal from temperature controller TIC821 is set point for power controller EIC822. Temperature controller TIC821 controls the temperature of the flue gas at the absorber outlet. The output signal from the temperature controller is limited by a unit, hence the input is limited so that the spreader motor is not overloaded. The spreaders power is proportional to the flow of feeder slurry. Therefore the motor power is used to control the flow. The power is given as function of feeder flow as shown in the diagram. The signal denoted H1 corresponding to flow of flue gas is input to the temperature controller TIC821. The controller's gain increases with increasing load or flow of flue gas. The flow is proportional to the square root of pressure drop over the absorber. The gas flow is also indicated on FI749 by Aroskraft. They determine the flow based on measurements of the flow of combustion air. The temperature is measured both before and after the absorber. The SO and dew point 2 instruments is located in a shed on plane +41. Sensors are installed in the flue gas channel at the fans outlet. The spreader tank is filled with a mixture of product slurry and lime suspension. The absorber has two inlets for flue gas, one for 40% (bottom inlet) and one for 60% of the flue gas (on top of the absorber). In the middle the spreader is placed which is fed with slake from the spreader tank. The spreader is rotating with high speed to mix flue gas with product slurry. There in only one outlet for flue gas. The Flue gas enters a diffuser in lower and upper section which makes the flue gas rotate and spreads out so the mixing effect between flue gas and product slurry is maximum. The rotating spreader is giving the product slurry a great speed when entering the absorber. The speed of the spreader is about 11000 RPM. There are also a valve to operate the absorber in by-pass. 2.9.28.2 Sequence S813: Operation of spreader STEP 2: Air fan running 80 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Oil valve open STEP 3: Oil pump running Bearing oil OK Gear oil OK Oil"

The reaction in the absorber is carried out in two ways. The absorbent will partly react with the flue gas content of sulphur dioxide and chlorides and the water content of the absorbent will be evaporated. The evaporation process is total so the remainings is a dry powder which is separated in the El-filter after the absorber. Some of the recidues is also falling down into the bottom of the absorber. The recidues from the absorber is taken to an ash silo. This delivers ash for production of a product called cefill. The recidues from the El-filter is transported with a powder pump to a product silo for recirculation. The product slurry system has two parallel lines, where one is in reserve. 84 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 2.9.29.2 Sequence S815: Transport of product from Absorber to ash silo or Product container INTERLOCK Inlet Ash Silo and Product Silo closed STEP 1: PS filter fan running STEP 2: Cell feeder fan running STEP 3: Conveyor running STEP 4: Cell feeder started STEP 5: Absorber mill running STEP 6: STEP 51: Wait 20s Absorber mill stopped STEP 52: Wait 40s Filter outlet damper closed STEP 53: Wait 2m Cell feeder transporter stopped STEP 54: Cell feeder fan stopped STEP 55: 2.9.29.3 Sequence S816: Product transport from filter to product and ash silo INTERLOCK Inlet Ash Silo and Product Silo closed STEP 1: Product silo filter fan running STEP 2: Product silo transport"

It plays an important role in the process where it is used to increase the contact area between slake suspension and flue gas. There are two independent processing lines. One line may be in operation while the other is in a state of preparation. As soon as a mixing tank contains slurry, the slurry is pumped via the pipes to the shut off valve in front of the feeder tank. A density meter is installed at the discharge side of the slurry pump. The measurement is used to compute content of pulp in the slurry and is input to controllers DIC810 and DIC814. The flow of product slurry is measured at the inlet of the feeder tank. Measurements of flow and level (output from level controller LIC812) are combined, and the result is used as set point value for flow controller FIC813. The set point must exceed a certain threshold before the controller starts to open the water valve at the mixing tank. The"

Set SO controller to Auto. 2 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 180 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 4 APPENDIX A PROCESS SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS SEQUENCER The sequence is controlled by a Process Sequence Agent based on the following principles: A sequence can be started, stopped, stepped, set or reset. Step numbers (0,1,2,3,--) will indicate how the sequence is progressing. A main job step number and a sub job step number will be indicated when the sequence is running or paused. Two text lines corresponding to the main and sub job step numbers will automatically be displayed. A coloured frame surrounding each control sequence “panel” will change colour according to the following state table: State 0: Black Sequence not started State 1: Green Sequence finished State 2: Orange Sequence going on State 3: Blue Sequence pause State 4: Red Sequence alarm A vertical “time” bar (0-100 %) indicates amount of work done while estimated time left (in seconds) is shown on a digital display. An indicating diode labelled “Ready” gives additional information. The diode light can have the four “colours” dark green, green, flashing green or red and must be interpreted relative to present sequence state. The model drawing associated with the ongoing job is shown on the MD push button placed at the lower right corner. There is also a push button for easy finding appropriate model variable pages related to the sequence. The first page gives start permitted/set permitted data. The second page contains settable parameters for adjusting sequence execution rate and step type, besides some auxiliary variables. The third page is mainly for future needs. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 181 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 State 0 / Black frame / Sequence not started A press on “START” or “STEP” will, if start permitted, activate the sequence and transfer it to state 2, “Sequence going on”. A green ready-diode indicates that the present process conditions are such that start is permitted, while a dark diode indicates that it is not permitted. A press on the sequence model variable page button displays the start permitted requirements. A red ready-diode signals that the sequence has been disabled. The instructor can disable some or all sequences from simulator control model variable pages 0102/0103. The sequence can be manually set (“marked as finished”) by pressing “SET”. Requirements for set permitted are also displayed on the associated sequence model variable page. Note that the ready-diode does not reflect any set permit information. A sequence can be set but not started and vice versa, dependent on process conditions, as shown on the sequence model variable page. State 1 / Green frame / Sequence finished In"

    "text": "on the associated sequence model variable page. Note that the ready-diode does not reflect any set permit information. A sequence can be set but not started and vice versa, dependent on process conditions, as shown on the sequence model variable page. State 1 / Green frame / Sequence finished In “Sequence finished” state one of three additional texts are given as a reminder: After a normal sequence run the text “Sequence successfully completed” is shown. If the sequence is manually marked as finished, the text “Sequence manually set” appears. In this case also the time bar will show zero, to further distinguish the properly run and finished sequences from the ones manually set. If the ready-diode is red the text “Sequence to be checked” is displayed. This means that the set permitted conditions specified on the sequence model variable page, are not fulfilled and that the process appears not to be in a state normally reached after running the sequence. Pressing “RESET” will transfer the sequence to state 0, “Sequence not started”. 182 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 State 2 / Orange frame / Sequence going on In “Sequence going on” a vertical time bar (0-100 %) indicates time left / work done. In addition to the time bar, estimated time left (in seconds) is shown on a digital display. The model drawing associated with the ongoing job is indicated on the MD push button placed at the lower right corner. Pressing the MD button will make transfer to the picture indicated. Note also that an expedite return to the Process Sequence picture is possible by pressing the “Back” push button on the new “MC90-V” type footer bar. The ready-diode will be flashing green to draw attention to the running condition. The sequence can be set manually in pause, state 3, by pressing “STOP”. If the sequence was started by a “STEP” command, it will automatically transfer to state 3, “Sequence pause” when the step is finished. A step can be defined as a long step (= continue until next change in main job index) or a short step (= continue until next change in sub job index). The step type parameter can be set from the sequence model variable page. The ongoing sequence can be terminated and marked as “completed” by a “SET” command. This requires that the set permit conditions are met. The operator is expected to validate process conditions after such a sequence short cutting. Each step has been given a maximum time for completion. If the current time limit it exceeded, the sequence will be transferred to state 4, “Sequence alarm” State 3 / Blue frame / Sequence pause"

The operator must take responsibility for checking process and make corrective interventions if necessary. State 4 / Red frame / Sequence alarm Red, flashing sequence frame is indicating a sequence time-out error. Press on “RESET” transfers state to 3, “Sequence pause”. A new “START” or “STEP” command will then make the sequencer retry processing the current sequence step, the one that caused time-out. Press on “START” or “STEP” with flashing red frame will abort the currently failing sub step and make the sequence continue from the next step in line. Note that the sequence system is presently implemented with no direct connection between actual process alarms and a sequence alarm state. 184 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 5 APPENDIX B STEAM PLANT SEQUENCE SEQUENCE 01 - INITIAL PREPARATIONS ---------------------------------- 1 Preparing Electric Power Supply 1.1 Connecting electric bus-tie breaker 1.2 Connecting fast circuit breaker 1.3 Connecting electric feeder cbr 2 Checking External Supplies - MVP0100 2.1 Setting auxil steam pressure/temp 2.2 Setting auxil DHW supply temp - T00325 2.3 Setting auxil water supply - T00320 3 Preparing Turbine for 48h Slow-Turning 3.1 Starting turbine casing drain system 3.2 Starting turbine lubrication (main lube oil) 3.3 Starting turning gear (auto clutch) 4 Draining Fuel Oil Service Tank 4.1 Opening HFO tank bottom drain valve 4.2 Waiting for water drain to finish 5 Preparing Fuel Oil Supply System 5.1 Lining up HFO tank transfer system 5.2 Starting HFO tank heating by sec. hot water 5.3 Checking HFO tank temperature set-point 6 Preparing Auxil Cooling System 6.1 Starting auxil coolw (for ventilation/LO etc) 7 Terminating Sequence 7.1 Resetting alarms ++ Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 185 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 SEQUENCE 02 - CONDENSATE MAKE UP SYSTEM ---------------------------------------- 1 Preparing Make-Up Deaerator 1.1 Activating clean water supply controllers 1.2 Starting condensate make-up pumps 1.3 Setting level controllers to auto"

A demonstration Sequence 24 demonstrates a “single push” start-up from cold plant to maximum electric power, 250 MW. It is an administrative sequence that starts appropriate other sequences when needed and as fast as possible. The following time table gives more details on the procedure involved. Cold condensing mode is used so there is no district heat production. Total time required is approximately 3 hours in real time on the simulator. When running this demonstration it is recommended to speed up the simulation model execution by a factor of 5 (Set “simulation speed ratio”, X94001, to 5.0) Sequence Started Finished Sequence text 24 0:00 3:08 From Cold Plant to Max Power 01 0:00 0:09 Initial Preparations 02 0:02 0:11 Condensate Make-up System 03 0:11 0:28 Small Clean-up Loop 04 0:28 0:38 Fuel Oil Supply Heating 05 0:28 0:54 Big Clean-up Loop 25 0:31 1:25 Desox Plant 06 0:51 1:05 Boiler Ignition 07 1:05 1:47 Pressure Rising to 15 bar 08 1:07 1:24 Cold Condenser Vacuum 09 1:21 1:38 Feed Water Deaerator Heating 10 1:47 1:57 Pressure Rising to 30 bar 11 1:47 1:49 Preparing LP Feed Heaters 12 1:57 2:08 Turbine Rolling-up 13 2:08 2:11 Turbine Connection 14 2:11 2:13 Block Binding 15 2:12 2:15 Preparing HP Feed Heaters + misc 16 2:15 2:35 Pressure Rising to 70 bar 23 2:27 3:06 Full El-Power Production / CC Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 213 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 7 APPENDIX D TPP PROCESS COMMENTS In the following pages, comments are made on functions and"

MD100 – Fuel Oil System MVP0100 Heating of the HFO tank is taken from a secondary hot water supply, represented by the variable T00320, auxiliary water supply temperature. The supply pressure is fixed at 10 bar. The hot water is indirectly heated by the (external) DHW system. MVP0110 The chemical composition of the fuel oil contained in the tank can be set from this page. From the “ingredients list” actual lower heat value and combustion air demand is computed. Final adjustment of computed heat value, theoretical air consumption and NOx/CO generation can be done at will. MVP1002 The HFO tank must be drained regularly. The “drain index” is used to control the colour of the drain funnel: 0,1,2 = off, on+water, on+fuel oil The nominal water content in the fuel is settable from MVP0110.X00807 Actual water content in tank outlet fuel flow is shown by MVP1002.X01036 High water level in the service tank will give extra water content in out-flowing fuel. Suction height is set at 1.0 m. Water level below 0.6m has no influence. Water level between 0.6 and 1.0m will result in gradually more water in outlet flow and correspondingly reduced heat value. There is not modelled any tank water settling process as such. Malfunction M1001, “tank heater leakage”, will give a steady increase in tank water level. Malfunction M1004, “tank water high”, will set the water level high and give a noticeable reduction in effective fuel heat value. Auto-auto standby function All major pumps have the basic “start-at-low-pressure” type standby logics. Alarm will be given at start. There is no function for automatically stopping the standby-started pump. Stopping is up to the operator to decide. HFO pump 1 can be set in “auto-auto”. In this mode the pump is started and stopped when required and no start/stop alarm is normally given. The pump should be set in Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 215 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 auto-auto when the coal mills are in operation. The HFO system is then kept hot by the circulation pump while the main pump is used only during burner start/stop operations. MVP1040 The HFO pump 1 will start when some oil burners are on, will stop when no oil burners are"

MVP1040 The HFO pump 1 will start when some oil burners are on, will stop when no oil burners are on. Auto-auto mode requires that the HFO circulation pump is running and appropriate pump/tank valves are open. MD120 – Secondary Steam System MVP1204 The steam cooling tank is supplied with some steam for warm keeping, even when there is no outgoing steam. The steam cooling tank will therefore tend to gradually fill up. Necessary periodical draining is handled by the auto drain valve, which should always be kept in auto. The drain valve opens above 0.9 m and closes blow 0.7m (C01268/C01269) MVP1205 When steam heating is from the external “auxil steam system”, be sure to keep the drain return valve to the assumed external “auxil water tank”, in auto. MVP1223 The controller after the drain pump keeps the inspection tank level at set point. To avoid overfilling the LP steam generator tank, the drain controller is gradually choked at increasing steam generator level. Below “normal” level there is no overriding; at “high” value the control valve is completely closed. MD140 – Burner Plane A MVP0111 The main chemical components of the coal can be specified. The sum of the five components C,H,S,O,N should preferably add up to 100 % , to avoid confusion, but it is not strictly necessary, because the C,H,S,O,N setting is always recalculated to a 100 % basis before used in other computations. Water and “inert” matter (ash/slag) should then be added. The water content varies much and has great impact on the amount of preheating required by primary air. Computed is lower heat value (including water/inert matter) and theoretical combustion air needed and flue gas produced. Computed is also (not shown) the important gas parameter, specific flue gas heat (kJ/kgC), used in the furnace model. The air/flue gas values are given in ncm/kg (ncm=normal cubic meter). Empirical adjustment factors are available for trimming final values. 216 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 MVP1425 The air/fuel ratio of each burner plane can be adjusted by the “air ratio adjust” factors, one for oil fuel and one for coal fuel. Adjusting these factors will lower or raise the air/fuel profile used by the Fuel Master Controller (MD180) when splitting up the general energy command into actual burner plane air, oil and coal flow set point commands. MD170 – Burner Plane D MVP0112/0113 A set of fuel data reflecting typical values for bio fuel like wood pellets is available. To demonstrate bio-fuel"

MD170 – Burner Plane D MVP0112/0113 A set of fuel data reflecting typical values for bio fuel like wood pellets is available. To demonstrate bio-fuel firing, select “pellets” on MVP0113. The coal silos are then filled with pellets and the coal mills are assumed rebuilt to fit the new material. To compensate for the reduced heat value, the mill and feeder equipment capacity is also increased, default setting is 140 %. 100 % represents the original coal mill capacity, 20 t/h. MVP1709 A burner can only be started when the preset ready-conditions are satisfied. When a burner is started, the fuel oil and secondary air controllers are switched to auto. When a burner plane is off, all controllers are kept in manual. To start a coal mill, all burners one the plane must be burning on fuel oil. Note also that the manually operated primary air fan inlet shut off damper must be open to get ready- signal. The primary air temperature/flow controller and the coal feeder speed controller are all handled by the coal mill sequence logics. The temperature of the ring channel air can be insufficient for coal drying at start-up and low load, especially if the coal is wet. The two planes that are started first, plane C and D, are equipped with electric primary air preheaters to speed up the preheating of the coal mill. The electric heaters are manually operated only. A flow guard device turns the heater off if the primary air flow is below a low limit (3 t/h) (hidden function). MVP1725 The temperature set point of the primary air controller is ramped up to running value from a start value, for smooth start-up performance. The mill air outlet temperature must be above 80 dgrC before the mill table starts rotating and pressure is put on the mill rollers to grind the coal to powder. MVP1730 The primary air flow in the coal powder tubes is kept sufficiently high to have air velocity in the tubes higher than the flame combustion front speed, 10-15 m/s. This ensures that no furnace flame can burn back towards the mill. For safety the mill is tripped at low primary air flow and also at high air temperature. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 217 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The coal tubes are heavily built to avoid damage from possible coal powder back-feed explosions. The tubes therefore have a significant thermal heating-up delay. The preheating of the primary air piping system is simulated 3-4 times faster than in actual plant."

MD180 – Boiler Combustion Control MVP1823 The energy commands are given in standard HFO flow units (t/h). All measured fuel flow signals are converted to equivalent standard HFO values (“normalized” HFO values) before used in the controller system. Air requirements are computed (trimmed) from fuel heat value setting. To simplify preparations when changing fuel type, current heat value figures, C11844/45/46, are automatically set to the controller, unlike on the actual plant’s equipment. The basic fuel/air control profile is defined by the master air bias/range parameters, C11847 and C11848. The adjustment span of the oxygen controller, C11846, can also be changed. The measured oxygen content in flue gas is alarmed. Both low and high limits are dynamic and change with fuel mix and boiler load. A recommended best range for control is indicated. When automatic oxygen set point setting is used, an intermediate “best” value is selected. MVP1830/31 To be able to keep tight trip limits, proper signal delays are necessary for avoiding too sensitive trip reactions. The trip delays are simulated as 1. order filters , with filter constants (tc) as specified. The term “water saturation ” denotes the temperature difference between economiser boiling temperature at current outlet pressure and actual economizer water outlet temperature. “Over Burner Air” To reduce NOx generation, a portion if the secondary air is split off the main duct and entered a third channel just above the burner. The damper controlling this “over-burner- air”, abbreviated OBA, can fail, see malfunction M1800. Failing OBA control can be detected by an abnormal flame display. The NOx generated from the faulty burner will also increase, resulting in an a higher overall NOx flow reading (see MD200/G02197) 218 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 MD190 – Block Master Control System MVP1900 The control profiles for converting from power to steam flow, drawn as white boxes in the picture, are each defined by two parameters.

Note that the support function must be moderate, for safe and stable combustion control. For demonstrating its effect, the electric grid frequency must deviate from standard value, 50Hz. The instructor can introduce load unbalances on the external grid to create dynamic frequency changes, or the grid frequency can be adjusted manually in “grid fixed” mode, see MD380 MVP1921 When the BLW controller is in manual, the temperature set point is tracking current DHW supply temperature, as long as the TMC controller also is in manual mode. The BLW temperature set point can be connected to “recommended line temperature”, but only if the BLW and BLM controllers both are in auto. The active temperature set point is rate limited for safety reasons. MVP1922 The BLM controller can only be put in auto if either the BLE or the BLW controller is connected. As long as the BLM controller is in manual, the BLE or the BLW system is tracking current steam production if set in auto mode. Connection of BLM is therefore bumpless. The controller output is limited to max value 96 % if in auto, C11949, no limitation in manual control. MVP1923 The optimal way of operating when producing hot water for district heating, is to adjust the firing rate so that the turbine system can operate as close to pure ”back pressure” Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 219 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 mode as possible. This situation produces maximum cheap electric (spin-off) power in relation to delivered city heat. The balancing signal shown is used to gradually adjust the LP turbine / DH split controller (TMC) to neutral position. The balancing set point is set slightly towards the “direct heater dump” side (50.5%) MVP1930 The active master energy signal is limited by the BLR system to a safe, process condition dependent maximum value. For instance, during coal firing the maximum rate is reduced from 60 t/h to 50.4 t/h (48,6 t/h if pellets). The load reduction is necessary mainly because of insufficient flue gas fan capacity and because of too short fuel resident time for complete combustion in the furnace. Violating the maximum firing rate limits may result in high CO-values and pose problems keeping the proper furnace under-pressure, especially at high ambient temperature and humidity.

In auto mode burner planes are started and stopped according to the FMC fuel command signal. The burner plane trigger limits can be adjusted. If the first plane is burning on coal, new burner planes will also be started up on coal by the Burner Management system. MVP1941 Various time blocking limits are used in the final processing of the start/stop commands to avoid burner cycling. All burner operations are time-checked. If a preset maximum time is exceeded, burner fault will be indicated by Burner Management state diode changing from green (ready) to red (burner fault).

The absolute and relative air humidity at the combustion fans is computed. The combustion air is heated in the turbine hall/boiler building, but no moisture is assumed added.

MVP2025 To reduce NOx , additional air above all burner planes is added. This “over-fire-air” reduces NOx by enabling richer fuel mix in the high-temperature combustion zone at the burners (two step combustion). Approximately 10 % of the combustion air is added as OFA air. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 221 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 MD210 – Combustion Air Preheaters MVP2106 The condition of the air sealing between air and gas rotor departments can be checked by monitoring the oxygen content before and after the preheater. In the simulator the leakage flow is explicitly displayed on this page. MD240 – Boiler Water System MVP2422 The speed of the feed water pumps are adjusted until the feed water control operates at a suitable degree of valve opening. The feed water pump speed control set point is computed from the boiler steam flow according to the parameters shown: K12538, K12539, C12538 and C12539 MVP2423 The feed water master controller adjusts the feed water flow command in order to keep a constant degree of superheating of the steam leaving the boiler. This important, but very sensitive control loop, easily tends to oscillate. To stabilize the control, three auxiliary feed forward signals are used as supplements to the steam temperature feed back: - boiler fuel flow - boiler water charge - boiler water flow deviation (steam - water) The control gains associated with these signals are shown on the page and can be adjusted.

It will be ramped up at a safe rate when steam temperature increases, to the final (target) value. For the SH2 controller, a minimum temp set point limit and a maximum increase rate can be adjusted from the page. The target temperature is the value displayed as “set point” on the SH2 temp controller. This set point is normally kept fixed at 475 dgrC. The dynamic set point/rate limitation mechanism can not be turned off for the SH2 control. MVP2604 Soot-blowing must be done at regular intervals. Details other than steam consumption are not modelled. MD260 – Main Steam Lines MVP2602 The HP safety valve has a fixed, mechanical limit of 220 bara. The IP safety valve has one fixed, mechanical limit at 52 bara, but can in addition be opened by a remotely controlled signal when in auto. The auto open limit is computed from the HP steam pressure. The safety valve profile is designed to keep the ratio between IP and HP pressure below a safe value, because a high IP/HP steam pressure ratio can cause HP turbine to overheat. The active open pressure limit is always displayed on the IP safety valve panel. MVP2604 Steam leakages from the HP, IPC or IPH steam lines can be introduced as malfunctions and checked at this page. MVP2605 To protect against condenser overheating, the steam dump is tripped at low cooling water supply pressure, high steam temperature and poor condenser vacuum. A trip is reset simply by opening the trip valve. Note that the condenser vacuum trip function is inhibited during partial vacuum breaking ( vacuum breaker trip = 6 ) MVP2623 The permitted rate of pressure increase can be adjusted by the two parameters “glide time constant” and “glide margin”. The glide function can not be engaged below min pressure, 22 bara. The HP glide control is automatically turned off at turbine trip.

If set to standby, there will be an immediate transfer from manual to auto at turbine trip and the set point will be reduced to the value given by parameter C22618 (9.50 bara). MVP2625 In manual mode the steam dump set point is again tracked by the IPH steam line pressure. If the controller standby mode is set, there will be an automatic transfer from manual to auto control if the turbine should trip, helping to limit the steam line pressure rise following the trip incident. The dump set point will be set to C22648 (10 bara) MVP2630 The HP turbine may overheat if its back pressure is high compared to turbine inlet pressure. The HP turbine is protected from overheating by two different actions that both tend to reduce the IP line pressure: opening of the IP turbine inlet (“intercept”) valve and opening of the IP safety valve. Note that only a possible IP turbine valve reduction, set by manual choking, will be lifted. Throttling caused by the governor speed reduction command is not affected. MD300 - Steam Turbine MVP3012 Auxiliary systems are greatly simplified. Sealing steam is normally taken from the IP line. During start-up when the boiler pressure is low, steam from the (external) auxiliary steam supply can be used. No details on the sealing steam pressure control system is modelled. However, if the sealing steam supply is turned off, there will be increased air leakage to the condenser, and it will be impossible to reach full condenser vacuum. The electric lube oil pumps are used during turbine rolling up only. If the electric governing oil pump is not on at low turbine speed, the vacuum breaker valve on the condenser opens due to low governing oil holding pressure. If the electric lube oil pump is not running at low turbine speed, the turbine is kept in a tripped condition with closed inlet and outlet steam shut off valves. At high turbine speed, the (hidden) attached lube oil pumps are sufficient. The electric oil pumps are stopped above 2790 rpm and restarted below 2400 rpm. The turbine’s vibration monitoring system is in the simulator represented by one representative overall vibration signal. 40 um (micrometer) amplitude is displayed as 100 % vibration.

MVP3022 The output from the turbine min pressure controller functions as a limiting signal to the speed governor (low-selection type logic). It can not be engaged below the low limit, 60 bara. When active, it throttles the turbine steam admission valves if the inlet pressure should drop below 70 bara. This helps keeping the boiler pressure/temperature up at low turbine load, which is safe for the boiler and gives a faster response at load increase. MVP3023 If “Turbine vacuum protection” is on, the governor command is reduced if poor vacuum (low-selection type logic). The protection characteristic is defined by the four parameters (C13057, C13058, K13057 and K13058). The “Turbine vacuum breaking” function helps reducing the turbine speed as fast as possible to a safe level during turbine trip. This is accomplished by opening the vacuum breaker valve to increase the condenser pressure. When the turbine speed has dropped below 2200 rpm, the vacuum breaker valve will intermittently close and open to keep the condenser pressure between 200 and 230 mbar. Resetting the vacuum breaker trip also clears the breaking function and full vacuum can be obtained. MD380 - Electric Generator System Normally the turbine is operated with 100 % open steam admission valves, to avoid throttle losses. However, if the line frequency increases above 50 Hz, the turbine governor immediately reduces the steam throttle. Low line frequency normally will be counteracted by increasing steam production. Extra firing can automatically be ensured by the frequency support function of the Block Master Controller. MVP3810 A dynamic, external electric grid model has been included. The size of the grid is defined by the limits C03805, C03806. Acceptable range limits are 500-8000 MW The final consumer load connected to the grid can be set, E03805, and the actual consumption, E03806, will be ramped up or down according to preset rates, C03807 and C03808. The power producers will respond to changes in grid frequency and voltage and hopefully, by the joint action of the External and TPP power plants, a new power balance eventually will be restored at correct frequency and voltage. When the actual load is close to the maximum grid power limit, C03805, the TPP plant needs to take its share of the load deficiency to obtain balance.

MVP3811 The external grid model can be de-activated and the grid set to fixed frequency and voltage values. The frequency/voltage on the grid are then settable directly from the page (V03800, F03801) or can be adjusted from increase/decrease push buttons on the picture. MVP3830 When the turbine trips, the main circuit breaker should normally trip due to under- current, after some delay. The main circuit breaker is deliberately not tripped directly from the turbine trip system due to safety considerations. If the turbine steam throttle valves are worn they may be leaking. Disconnecting the turbine with leaking throttle valves may cause turbine over-speeding and damage. Disconnecting the turbine by an “under- current trip” is proving that the steam throttle valves are in tact. Comment: The trip limit C03894 has no effect and should be removed in future simulator SW releases. MD400 - Cold Condenser System MVP4000 The number of active cooling tubes in the condenser can be changed by the “tube number factor”, C14030. Tube number factor = 2.0 means that the number of cooling tubes has been doubled (same diameter and length). Tube number factor = 0.7 means that 30 % of the cooling tubes have been plugged. The parameter can be convenient to use for studying the influence of small/large condenser on overall plant performance. The cold condenser hotwell conductivity is monitored and alarmed, X04028. It is (slowly) influenced by the water purity in the main condensate tank. It will increase sharply if there is a cooling water leakage into the condenser. ( micS/m = microSiemens/m ) MVP4004 The nominal capacity of the cooling pumps can be adjusted by the general capacity- parameter C14031. This is intended to be used together with the tube number factor, C14030, when condenser performance is studied.

Note that opening the vacuum breaker valve also will trip the turbine. Vacuum breaker trip caused by high LP heater level is indicated by trip code 1, 2 or 3. If, after a turbine trip, the vacuum breaker is opened to speed up turbine breaking, the trip code is 6 (“Partial vacuum breaking”). MVP4040 In back pressure turbine mode, with active hot condensers, the cooling water and condensate pumps should be in standby mode. Only auxiliary pumps need to be running. The normal (basic) standby start function is trigged by either low cooling water pressure or high condenser pressure. In auto-auto control coolw pump 1 is started/stopped from the LP turbine damper position signal, Z13803. A hysteresis band is defined by the parameters K13803 and K13804. The band is necessary to avoid mode cycling during back pressure plant control. MVP4041 Normal standby start of the condensate pumps is from high hotwell level detection. Auto-auto start/stop of condensate pump 1 is controlled from a modified LP turbine damper position signal: If the main circuit breaker (MCB) disconnects, the control signal will be set to 100 % and result in an immediate transition to main cooling mode. This is to secure adequate cooling water pressure for the steam dump operation, which is likely to be activated at this incident.

The release of oxygen in feed water by heating is simulated by a simple model unit. If the vent valve to the bottom blow tank (BB) is closed and the steam heating is on, the released inert gas will gradually build up. Measured tank pressure will then be higher than the saturation pressure for the actual temperature. When the plant is shut down and the tank gets cold, the reverse process takes place; oxygen in the tank atmosphere is gradually absorbed.

The high pressure pump speed is geared up by a factor of 5.3 MVP4312 The electric motor is an asynchronous (induction) motor with wound rotor and slip rings. The speed is controlled by varying the resistance in the rotor circuit. High resistance gives high slip and low speed. The external rotor resistance consists of a DHW-cooled electrolyte vessel with variable electrode submersion. The rotor losses associated with the speed control, which are substantial, are therefore not lost but converted to useful district water heat. Note that the resistance vessels, one for each motor, are modelled but not shown on any MD pictures. MVP4320 The FW deaerator level controller uses as feed forward signal net tank outlet flow. MVP4321 228 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 The pressure of the FW deaerator is free to drift up and down according to plant load, as long as the pressure is above a minimum limit, 2.50 bara In order to prevent fast pressure reductions, which can lead to feed water pump cavitations and sudden loss of feed water flow in worst case, the controller works as a pressure reduction rate limiter. The rate gain setting is indirectly defined by the two parameters “glide dp” and “glide tc” MVP4330 An optical detector is measuring the sparking intensity from the rotor slip rings. Poor brush contact will increase light sparking and eventually cause trip 6: light arc.

The pressure standby limit is set as an ultimate low limit only, and will normally not activating a pump start. In stead a special standby start logic unit is used to start a ready feed water pump, whenever pumps in operation are electrically stopped. MD440 - High Pressure Feed Heaters MVP4430/4431 HP heater 1 and 2 are protected from overfilling by tripping the heater’s inlet steam valve at high drain level. HP heater trip also opens the HP heater bypass line valve. The trip levels (C14455, C24455) are both set to 2.5 m MVP4432 If the drain level of HP heater 1 or 2 continues to rise (due to HP heater tube leakage) and finally exceeds high-high level, all three HP feed heaters are isolated by closing the inlet and outlet protection valves in the feed water line. The emergency (“FW”) trip limits (C14458, C14459) are set to 3.0 m To demonstrate trip of HP heaters, set malfunction M4412, “HP feed heater 2 tube leakage”, use fault value 40 %. Drain level will gradually increase in the feed heater, steam inlet valve will trip and bypass feed water valve open. But level will continue to increase, proving a tube leakage. The HP heater train is finally isolated and leakage flow from the damaged tube stops. MD500 – Make Up Deaerator System MVP5000 The “water purity” variable is intended to reflect content of ions and dissolved CO2/O2. The initial “Cold Plant” condition has a rather poor water quality. Operating the make- up deaerator stripper during clean-up recirculation will gradually improve water quality.

To avoid excessive vibrations, the minimum temperature controller will reduce the cooling water flow and thus limit the vacuum in the condensers. MVP6023 The return/supply pumps are operated so that the water pressure in the grid supply lines is in the normal range, 5-7 bar. A pressure sensor measures the difference between the supply and the return line pressure at a representative location in the city. The pressure at supply pump inlet is fixed to the expansion tank pressure (MD620), while the return pump inlet pressure can be trimmed by the supply/return speed balance setting. MVP6040 The HC pump standby start is controlled by the hotwell level in HC1, control by pressure is unreliable due to large variations in the condenser pressure. MD610 – Direct Heater System MVP6100 The level command to the direct heater controls the steam valve opening and the level controller set point. The steam valve, when in auto, opens at decreasing level command. The valve positioning profiles are defined by the parameters C06121/C06122 and C06141/C06142. MVP6122 230 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 When both remote signals, the LP bypass controller (LPC) and the DHW temperature controller (TMC), are connected, the signal with the lowest level command is selected. Profiles for converting remote control (dump) signal to level set point are defined by the parameters C06162/K06162 and C06162/K06162. MVP6123 The subcooler flow set point is increasing with drain flow, starting from a base value, C16115, and increasing according to the drain coefficient setting, C16116. MD620 – Accumulator System MVP6220 The feed forward signal, Z16344, the difference between turbine flow and pump flow, is an important signal for stabilizing the control loop. The pump speed control is of the same kind as used for the main feed water pumps and the DHW pumps: asynchronous AC motor, wound rotor with slip rings and variable external motor resistance (“rheostat”) MVP6221 To prevent the water in the low pressure accumulator tank to boil, a temperature limiting control is included. It keeps the water leaving the francis turbine below 95 dgrC MVP6222/6223 The expansion tank low/high level controllers are safety devices that should be standby, but they are normally not activated.

MVP7901++ All cleaning plant (sub) sequences can be operated from model variable pages, and to some extent be guided manually through the process of starting or stopping. At some situations a sequence can be caught in a state of dead-lock and there will be needed some manual “stepping support” from the operator in charge. This is done by manually increasing the step number (S07901 etc). Remember that starting steps are in the intervall1-49, stopping steps are in the interval 51-99. Step = 0 means that the sequence is in stable off or on state. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 231 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Never decrease the step number manually! MD800 – DeSOx Plant Overview MVP8901++ As for the deNOx plant, all cleaning plant (sub) sequences can be operated from model variable pages, and to some extent be manually overridden. MD850 – Product System A new product damper control system helps demonstrating the function of the deSOx – absorption process: The original manually controlled dampers of absorber and filter discharge products have now been changed to modulating dampers under automatic control. No exact details are given on the controller hiding behind the dotted “Damper Control” box. Briefly said, the controller is directing as much product flow to the recirculation product silo as is leaving from this silo to the mixer tanks. If the product flow from the filter assembly is insufficient, cross-over make up is taken from the absorber product line. This is the normal situation when firing with low-sulphur fuel (oil/bio). Then the feeder slurry consists mainly of re-circulated, chemically passive CaSO4. When firing with sulphur-rich fuel (coal) the absorber (SO2 controller / MD830) asks for Ca(OH2) rich feeder slurry with low content of re-circulated CaSO4. In this situation surplus filter product is cross-directed to the final product silo and is mixed with the absorber product there. 232 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 8 APPENDIX E TPP DESIGN REVIEW A short description if main software improvements implemented during winter/spring /autumn 2008 General Comments Improved graphics, main process lines draw broad, auxiliary lines narrow.

The FO is heated to normal operating temperature by either one of two steam heaters, before it flows to burner deck A-D. There is recirculation of fuel from the burner decks to the service tank during preheating or trip. The temperature of the fuel oil, which is measured in the common line after the FO heaters, is controlled by a temperature controller (PID) which controls the steam flow through the heaters. 248 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 12.1.3 MD 120 Secondary Steam System The LP steam generator produces secondary, low pressure steam to be used for the following purposes: - main boiler atomising steam - heating of storage and service tanks - heating of heavy fuel to burner deck A-D - production of cleaning steam The primary steam to the LP steam generator is normally supplied from the IP bleeder system. If the Intermediate turbine bleeder pressure is too low, steam is provided from the auxiliary steam system. In cases of emergency, the steam source is from the aux. steam system. The flow of steam to the heat exchanger in the steam generator's steam drum is automatically controlled to keep the secondary steam pressure constant. The condensate from the heating coil is drained to a separate primary drain tank before it is discharged to the make-up deaerator. The rate of primary condensate discharge is controlled so that the drain cooler always is filled with water. Secondary drain from miscellaneous heaters is collected in the inspection tank. This is designed for easy observation and removal of possible oil contamination. For production of cleaning steam and atomising steam a special steam cooling tank is provided. Supply to the steam cooling tank spray nozzles taken from the IP line. Both LP steam generator and steam cooling tank has a level control system and make- up water is taken from main condensate pumps.

The light off sequence will be indicated. Ignition is confirmed by the flame scanner signals. It is possible to change to coal firing, this requires that system for coal transportation system is running. Hot and cold air are mixed by a temp. controller, and a primary air fan supplies air to the coal grinder. The coal silo supplies coal to the coal feeder system. The coal feeder system supplies coal to the coal grinder. The coal dust is fed to the burners with conveyer air from primary air fan. The coal feeder system is controlled by a coal mill control panel. To light off a burner, press the START button and the light off sequence will be executed: The FO flow can be adjusted by manually controlled throttle valves. 250 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 12.1.5 MD 190 Block Master Control System The Block Master control system consits of two major parts: One part controlling the rate of fuel input to the boiler system ane one part controlling where to discharge the blocks’ waste heat. Part one is based on one steam controller (BLM) which has its set point generated either from an electric power controller (BLE) or from a district heat water temperature controller (BLW). The output signal from the steam flow controller is an energy signal for the fuel master control system. It is checked and possibly reduced in a logic system called “block load reduction system” (BLR). Part two consists of a single temperature controller (TMC). The inlet dampers of the LP turbines and the steam flow to direct heaters are controlled from measured district heat water temperature. The Block Load Master Controller (BLM) corresponds with the master steam pressure controller of fixed pressure boilers. It controls the steam flow according to set point. the Block load reduction system (BLR) limits the fuel command from the master controller if necessary. The limiting value is displayed (G01952). If this limit is exceeded, the BLM controller is switched to Manual, the fuel signal is reduced to limit, BLR alarm will be given (AG05.X01963) and the cause of the limitation indicated by a “reduction index”.

(To get reduction index text, click on index display.) An overview of load reduction causes and corresponding limits is given on MVP1901. Note that the reduction associated with the turbine trip or main circuit breaker trip, will be overidden if the turbine is not in operation. The inhibition signal for this is taken from the HP turbine supply valve, V03001. When this valve close, BLR reduction 4 & 5 are cancelled. An BLR action should be followed by manual firing at rates below BLR limit, until the cause of reduction is corrected. The BLR function is always present, regardless of Manual or Auto mode. In Auto mode, the limit not to be exceeded, G011952 is automatically set according to plant state. In manual mode, the limit must be manually set by the operator at his choice. In addition to the limiting function, the BLR controller performs rate limitations of the fuel command (up and down). If the source of a block reduction is corrected, the BLR system will slowly increase the fuel command towards the RLM controller command.

The feed water flow from the main feeder line is controlled by the feed water control valve. Its valve position can be set directly in LOCAL control. REMOTE control is from the boiler panel. The feed water is heated in a preheater before it is supplied to the economiser. After the economiser the feed water enters into the evaporator where steam is produced. The steam is then going to superheater 1. The superheated steam is then supplied to a steam/water separator which has a certain water level to isolate full steam pressure from the feed water deaerator tank. The steam is then led from the separator into superheater 2, from this into the desuperheater where the outlet steam temperature is regulated. The superheater and the steam supply lines are protected by a safety valve after the superheater. Valves for bottom blow off or top (surface skimming) blow off are included. The blow off goes to a bottom blow tank. For filling of boiler water a special line is provided called filling line.

Both district heaters have a level control system which controls a regulating valve on the outlet off the sub-coolers. The sub-coolers main purpose is to cool down the condensate from direct heater. In some situations the condensate could be very hot and this condensate is lined back to the condensate tank which contains \"cold\" water at atmospheric pressure. It is not recommended to supply water with this temperature difference direct to the condensate tank. The capasity of the direct heaters are controlled by the condensate level in the direct heaters. For high capasity, condensate level is low and for low capasity, water level is high.

The full heat production of 4 hours can be stored for later release. Operation of the heat storage tank will depend on electric power price, weather condition and time of day. The accumulator tank enables a more safe and optimal power plant operation. Normal procedure will be to charge the accumulator at day time and thus producing much electric power at high price, and discharge the accumulator during night when electric power price is lower. Hot water demand varies from hour to hour. For instance high hot water requirement in the morning 264 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 (showers), high power requirement in the afternoon (cooking) etc. The accumulator makes is easier to meet such changing heat loads and electric power demands. Accumulator tank The accumulator tank is operating at atmospheric pressure. It is based on the principle that hot water is lighter than cold water. It is therefor possible to store the water in stable temperature layers with hardly any inter mixing, assuming water is supplied to the tank top, or removed from the tank bottom without turbulence. The specific water density of 55 dgr C water is 986 kg/cubm, while it is 962 kg/cubm at 95 dgr C. This represents a weight difference of 25 kg/cubm. The useful load volume of the tank is 22000 cubm and the total heat storage capacity amounts to 1150 MW with a temperature difference of 45 dgrC. The maximum load or unload rate is 5000 cubm/h, which corresponds to approximately 250 MW. This means that the power plant has a good momentary heat reserve in case of disturbances like turbine or boiler trip. As the working pressure of the DHW pipe line is 80-100 mWL, 60-80 mWL pressure head is available for the water turbine installed to help driving the accumulator pump, pumping water back to the DHW pipe line from the accumulator tank. Turbine power varies with flow and pressure. It can be as high as 750 kW. Never the less, the turbine power is not in any mode of operation sufficient for driving the accumulator pump up to balanced water flow. The speed of the combined turbine/pump unit is boosted by an electric motor with speed control facility, to control the flows to and from the accumulator tank to desired (usually equal) values. Flow through the turbine is manually controlled by opening or closing the inlet dampers of the turbine. The volume difference between unloaded (cold) and loaded (hot) accumulator tank amounts to approximately 575 cubm. This corresponds to an"

The volume difference between unloaded (cold) and loaded (hot) accumulator tank amounts to approximately 575 cubm. This corresponds to an level variation of 0.5 m in the accumulator tank. The pump speed is controlled to keep the expantion tank level constant, and all variations in water density will be reflected in changing accumulator tank level. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 265 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Description of accumulator tank interior In the tank bottom there is a fixed distribution system for cold water. In the tank top there is a movable float arrangement with 4 movable floats mounted on 4 arms. The arms are flexibly connected to the hot water supply pipe in the center of tank. The system is designed to discharge water with as low velocity as possible, to avoid turbulence and mixing of hot and cold water layers. The volume above the water level is to be held free of oxygen. The air in the zone above the water is removed by a hot water spray system. A collecting arrangement for surface water is used for recirculation of spray water, which is kept at the boiling point by a steam heater. The steam to the heater is controlled according to the tank top pressure. Normal pressure is 30 mmWL above atmospheric pressure. To active the spray system, start the spray pump. The system is not modeled in detail. To protect the accumulator tank from excessive over or under pressure, a water seal is mounted a tank top. It opens at 65 mmWL and -40 mmWL. In addition safety valves open at 90 mmWL for extra protection (Not shown on drawing). The water temperature distribution vertically in the tank is monitored by 20 platina resistance sensors mounted on a vertical wire going from tank top to bottom. Turbine and pump unit Between the turbine and the pump is a centrifugal clutch mechanism that releases the turbine from the pump shaft when the turbine shaft speed is below 200 rpm. The turbine is a francis turbine type with spiral shaped inlet casing. Inlet dampers can be manually set for flow adjustment. The turbine shut off valve is closed if the electric motor stops, or if any trip signal is present. The turbine bearings are lubricated by a separate lubrication system including a LO cooler. This system is not modeled. The accumulator pump is of the same type and capacity as the DHW supply and return pumps. The speed can be controlled by varying the rotor resistance"

The accumulator pump is of the same type and capacity as the DHW supply and return pumps. The speed can be controlled by varying the rotor resistance through an electrolytic boiler rheostat, as for all major speed controlled pumps in the power plant system. 266 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 Accumulator temperature protection A temperature control system protects the accumulator tank from being loaded by too hot water. This is done by recirculation of cold water from the accumulator pump to turbine inlet, when necessary. If loading temperature exceeds 101 dgrC for some time, turbine trip signal will be given. If the turbine is set for accumulator tank loading, and the pump motor is started, an open pulse is given to the recirculation valve, for flushing of cold water through the turbine piping. The open pulse at start lasts for 100 sec. Expansion tank The pressure at the DHW supply pumps, called the “intermediate pressure”, is to be controlled within the range 7.5 to 8.5 bar. The pressure is controlled by water flowing back and forth between the supply pumps inlet and the expansion tank, depending on pressure head difference. The expansion tank has a steam cushion at top controlled by a separate steam system. The steam system is not modeled in detail. The tank bottom pressure will be the sum of the steam pressure at top and the static liquid pressure head. Normal tank level is 18 m. Make up/dump system If the expansion tank level gets too low for some reason, a special dump valve opens and dumps water from the DHW system to the accumulator tank. If the expansion tank level is too low, a make up controller opens the make up valve and water is pumped from the accumulator tank to the DHW system. The make up pumps are automoatically started when the make up valve position is more than 25 % open. The make up/dump system controlles the expansion tank level at times when the accumulator turbine/pump system is not in operation. Should a major leakage in the DHW net work occur, the make up pumps will start and alarm will be given if the make up flow is above a certain limit (150 t/h).

The method is built on a selective catalytic reduction. The medium used for the reduction is ammonia gas. The plant comprises two SCR (selective catalytic reduction) reactors and an ash silo. There are different dampers which is channelling the flue gas either into or bypass the SCR-reactor. Before the DeNOx plant can be set into operation a special heating procedure has to be done. A certain fouling of the catalysators is modelled. The effect of this fouling will be an increase of the difference pressure over the SCR. A manually initiated soot blowing will clean the surfaces in the reactor. 12.1.23 MD 710 SCR Reactor 1 There are two similar reactors. The boiler has two similar flue gas outlet manifolds, one for each reactor. Ammonia Injection The ammonia injection system comprises a high pressure fan, a gas mixer, and 16 nozzle pipes. The air is lead from the fan via a pipe to a mixing chamber where ammonia is injected. In the DeNOx plant simulator ammonia is supplied from a tank containing ammonia at a given pressure and temperature. After mixing, the gas is flowing to the nozzle tubes which are inserted into the flue gas channel at the reactor inlet. Measurement of NOx in the flue gas is used as input to the controller. A sensor installed in the reactor outlet channel is used to measure content of ammonia in the flue gas, and an alarm is issued in the case of high content. 268 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 SCR Reactors The cleaning of flue gas is based on the High Dust Principle. The flue gas passing through the reactor has a high content of foreign matter and sulphur. The reactor is made up of three parts, namely, the inlet, the reactor chamber, and the outlet. Flue gas and ammonia/air mixture enter the inlet at the top of the construction. The catalysts are of the plate type. The plates are covered with an active material, which constitutes the real catalyst. Reactor product handling Reactor product drops from the pockets through the channels and dampers down to the ejectors. From the ejectors the solids is transported to the cyclone by means of pressurised air. From the cyclone the stuff drops into the intermediate tank which has a capacity of 2 m3.

Soot Blowers Both reactors are furnished with soot blowers, and pressurised steam is used to clean the catalysts. The soot blowers are operated manually, either from the central control room or from a local panel. Reactor heating When starting up from cold state or in order to keep the reactor warm, hot combustion air is drawn from the spiral channel. A circulation fan is used to force the air through the reactor. Reactor drying In order to keep the reactor dry, for instance during shut down, the reactor is furnished with a dryer. A fan provides circulation of air through the reactor. Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual 269 Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 12.1.24 MD 800 DeSOx DeSulphurization Plant The plant has two silos for storage of lime, one main silo and one lime day silo. The lime is transported down to a weight system and a conveyer belt to feed a continuos and correct amount of lime to the slake system. From here the lime is led into the slake tanks. The overflow from the slake tanks are piped to the slake suspension tank where even more water are added to make the suspension pumpable. The slake suspension is pumped to a slake feeder tank through a strainer. The absorber has two inlets for flue gas, one for 40% (bottom inlet) and one for 60% of the flue gas (on top of the absorber). Ash from the absorber is taken out of the bottom of the absorber and out to a powder pump. There is an electro filter at the end of the system to remove combustion recidues and ash. 12.1.25 MD 810 Lime Silo The main purpose of this picture is to give an overview of the lime filling system. 3 Lime is filled by truck into the main lime silo, full capacity is 500m The lime day silo is filled by a conveyer belt and a scoop lift system. Full capacity is 20m3. The conveyer belt is fluidized with air to transport the lime in a sufficient way. The operation of the conveyer belt and scoop lift is operated by level switches for high and low level installed in the lime day silo.

There are two slake tanks in the system, one in operation and one in reserve. Lime from the lime day silo is taken into the slake tank via a transport system. Lime is mixed with water to make a slake suspension. The mixing water is taken from the district water system. The flow of mixing water and lime is controlled by a controller sensing SOx content in the flue gas. The slake suspension tank has a mixer system where the slake is mixed with more water to make the slake pumpable. There are two pumps supplying slake suspension to the feeder tank. These pumps has water supply for washing after they have been stopped and for sealing during operation. 12.1.27 MD 830 Feeder System The slake suspension is pumped from the slake suspension tank into the feeder tank. The feeder tank is also supplied from mixer tank 1 and 2. The purpose is to mix product from the electric filter with slake suspension. The slake suspension is supplied to a spreader tank which supplies the electrically driven rotating spreader. The overflow of this tank is returned to the feeder tank. The delivery out of the feeder tank is controlled by the level in the feeder tank, and the level is controlled by the filling from the slake suspension tanks. The setpoint is taken from the power used by the spreader.

When the SO absorber (slake and product slurry) is spreaded into the hot flue gas with the 2 rotating spreader a reaction will be established. The reaction in the absorber is carried out in two ways. The absorbent will partly react with the flue gas content of sulphur dioxide and chlorides and the water content of the absorbent will be evaporated. The evaporation process is total so the remainings is a dry powder which is separated in the el-filter after the absorber. Some of the recidues is also falling down into the bottom of the absorber.

Some of the recidues is also falling down into the bottom of the absorber. The dew point sensor is located in the chimney close to the SO sensor. Actually there 2 are two sensors. At start up, during heavy changes of load, and during abnormal operations, safety precautions require a flue gas set point with a higher margin to the dew point. The spreaders power is proportional to the flow of feeder slurry. Therefore the motor power is used to control the flow. The power is given as function of feeder flow as shown in the diagram. The temperature is measured both before and after the absorber. Sensors are installed in the flue gas channel at the fans outlet. The spreader tank is filled with a mixture of product slurry and lime suspension. The absorber has two inlets for flue gas, one for 40% (bottom inlet) and one for 60% of the flue gas (on top of the absorber). In the middle the spreader is placed which is feeded with slake from the spreader tank. The spreader is rotating with high speed to mix flue gas with product slurry. There in only one outlet for flue gas. The Flue gas enters a diffuser in lower and upper section which makes the flue gas rotate and spreads out so the mixing effect between flue gas and product slurry is maximum. There is also a valve to operate the absorber in by-pass. 272 Thermal Power Plant TPP User Manual Kongsberg Maritime Doc.no.: SO-1406-D / 11-Oct-13 12.1.29 MD 850 Product System The recidues from the absorber is taken to an ash silo.

The product slurry system has two parallel lines, where one is in reserve. 12.1.30 MD 860 Mixing System The slurry is composed of water, desulphurization product from the absorber, and product from the electric filter. There are two independent processing lines. One line may be in operation while the other is in a state of preparation. As soon as a mixing tank contains slurry, the slurry is pumped via the pipes to the shut off valve in front of the feeder tank. A density meter is installed at the discharge side of the slurry pump.
